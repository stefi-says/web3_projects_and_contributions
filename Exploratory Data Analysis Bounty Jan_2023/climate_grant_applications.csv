🚜  Agriculture is a primary driver of land, water degradation globally, and contributes significantly to global GHG emissions (>10%) food is essential for a community’s security & well-being, and is considered a matter of national security by modern nation-states. 

💐  Regenerative agriculture initiatives recognize the fragility of “modern” agriculture. They argue that resilient communities achieve food, water, material & medicinal security by restoring health to their surroundings and valuing ecosystem functions. It generally allows us to decolonize our minds that traditionally associate farming with mass monoculture to instead associate it with multiple and diverse species (wild, livestock, vegetative, & microbiome…) contributing to the resilience of a whole ecosystem. 

🌎  A global decentralized grants platform like Gitcoin offers a means for each of us to reclaim agency over the food system that we rely on. Let us be empowered and demonstrate the potential of quadratic funding to allocate, prioritize, as well as support transformative change to agriculture across scales. 

☀️ The initiatives represented by this bundle are collaborating with local communities and indigenous organizations while providing access to knowledge about regenerative agriculture as well as access to the tools for farmers. Creating these impacts in Kenya, Columbia, India, Croatia & the United States with disparate aims but a common mission and mandate to demonstrate and expand the role of free and open-source software in public goods funding.

If you would like to know more about the individual projects that have been gathered in this bundle, check below!

☕️  Coffee Carbon Collective, @CoffeeCarbonCo: supports coffee farmers in their transition to regenerative agriculture by providing agronomic guidance and rewarding them for the implementation of new practices. Coffee Impact Collective creates an ecosystem that provides multiple services and opportunities for farmers, allowing them to become a part of a decentralized marketplace where “regenerated” coffee is traded along with eco credits (like carbon, biodiversity, water quality, social impact, and eco-tourism), not separately.

🌸  Kanga Gardens, @Kangra_Gardens: The Kangra Gardens are a place for people to express gratitude and give back to the earth by respecting and learning from it. The purpose of the Kangra Botanical Garden, which is a part of Kula, is to regenerate the local ecosystem, promote biodiversity conservation, support community health, build towards food sovereignty and nutrition, and engage people in connecting with the environment. The garden uses Ayurvedic medicine production and syntropic farming to achieve these goals facilitated through a Bioregional Learning Center. The grant for Kangra Gardens aims to fund new as well as current contributors and the development of open-source documentation to share with the global community.

💧 Watercycle, @friedmanspace: Watercycle is developing an open-source, low-cost water structuring device to improve crop yields and accelerate natural carbon sequestration. Water structuring is the process of altering the structure of water to optimize its ability to support life. The benefits of water structuring in agriculture include improved soil structure, increased plant growth and yield, and reduced water usage.

🏝️ Ogallala.Life, @ogallalalife: We are a not-for-profit devoted to learning, exploring, developing & deploying web3 tools for landscape rehydration on and around the US high plains aquifer system. Our mission is to prove out market incentives for improved water recharge & retention - our communities place a tremendously high value on water security and ReFi offers novel mechanisms to invest in surrounding landscapes & watersheds. We’ve launched pilot projects along the Canadian River breaks to explore leaky weirs, riparian restoration, and similar interventions, & their impact on the water budget, biodiversity, carbon & climate. Our projects help facilitate the maturation of decentralized science applied towards regenerative aims through our active collaboration with dMeter, a DAO tasked to build tools for decentralized digital measure recordation & validation in natural capital context including but not limited to PES markets.

👨🏾‍🌾  Regrò, @projectregro: At Regrò farmers, gardeners and artists share their journeys about Regenerative Agriculture and Regenerative Finance. Under the increasing climate emergency pressure, the Regrò project aims to connect land owners, farmers, and growers, interested in sharing resources to build resilient agroecological systems through Regenerative and Conservation Agriculture, Permaculture, and non-invasive practices.

🌳  Ayowecca Uganda, @ayowecca_uganda: A community-founded organization working on nature-based solutions, Wetlands and peatland ecosystem restoration has been our focus. Together with the local community, we are restoring encroached wetlands and protecting those that already exist. Our strategy involves agroforestry and afforestation. We are promoting agroforestry, by giving farmers fruit trees to plant beside their crops to protect the degraded landscape, promote food security and raise food production. Climate change adaptation and mitigation are our primary goals in promoting agroforestry/regenerative agriculture and permaculture. The effects of climate change on agricultural communities can be lessened by planting trees in agricultural systems. Growing the number of trees on agricultural land decreases tree cutting and boosts carbon sinks.

 📡  dMRV Network, @dmrvnetwork: dMRV network puts the tools necessary in the hands of small-scale farmers and other marginalized communities so that they have the opportunity to collect and submit valuable ecological data for fair compensation. dMRV network is a decentralized organization of scientists, project developers, farmers, and regenerators that contributes to open source systems that allow for decentralized data collection correlation of ecological data into ecological credits and/or payments. The primary goal of dMRV Network is to create a guide for communities to identify the best practices, tools, and resources for maximizing value and ecological health via ecological service payments and/or credits.

🌱 The WeSeed Project @weseedrefi: The WeSeed Project is a unique initiative that aims to address global food insecurity challenges through the use of blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.

This is a new joint venture between ReFiDAO and Commons Stack that will pilot a new concept called a “ReFi Commons” across three local startup communities in 2023.

BACKGROUND

ReFiDAO is a founder-led startup community that accelerates impact for people and the planet.

Over the last 12 months we’ve laid the foundation for the cultural home of regeneration in web3 by supporting over 300 founders at various stages of their journey. 

We are now raising money to launch a ReFi Commons Incubator with Commons Stack. The idea of a ReFi Commons is new, and we are super excited to share it with you! 

But first, an update.

GR15 UPDATE

As a result of the $69,040 we received from the Gitcoin community in GR15, over the last three months we were able to achieve many key milestones:

- Support 152 founders in FC02
- Onboard over 70 community managers into the CM Guild
- Onboard over 20 regen investors 
- Reach 1700 newsletter subscribers
- Co-launch the $1M grant pool with Future Quest, Celo, Polygon, and others

REFI PASSPORT & KNOWLEDGE GRAPH

After consulting with the Gitcoin Passport team, we decided to delay ReFi Passport due to the rate of change for the Gitcoin Passport codebase in Q4 2022. 

We’ve been iterating a prototype of the knowledge graph around MRV (‘Measurement, Reporting & Verification’) with an alpha version in the works. 

We’ve expanded our directory to include people, content, deals and events—all of this aimed at helping onboard more talent and capital into the work of regeneration.

THEORY OF CHANGE

We believe that in order to realize a global regenerative economy, we need to fulfill three objectives:

1. A global startup movement rooted in diverse local communities
2. Hundreds of radical startup experiments drive exponential impact
3. Global coordination between private, public and civil society organizations

REFI COMMONS INCUBATOR

To test this evolved theory of change, we are raising money to launch a 6-month ReFi Commons Incubator with Commons Stack to accelerate the growth of local startup communities that fulfill three objectives:

1. Onboard new talent and capital into ReFi
2. Create radical startup experiments for exponential impact
3. Build public, private and civil society partnerships

The goal is to pilot the incubator with an initial cohort of three communities and to build a regular program that incubates ReFi Commons all over the world.

WHAT IS A REFI COMMONS?

A ReFi Commons is a founder-led impact DAO that exists to regenerate the earth through radical startup experimentation and innovation. 

A ReFi Commons could be created as a startup community in a specific city (Lisbon, Bangalore) or a startup ecosystem focused on a shared problem space (such as plastic pollution or biodiversity).  

The models and methods of regeneration are unique to each community, but there are a few key criteria:

1. Mission, vision, and values statements establish the commons
2. All funds must be held in a public treasury 
3. Community curates governance parameters and procedures
4. Impact activities must be publicly verifiable
5. Funded startup ventures must be open source
6. Impact and finances are reported quarterly
7. Three or more founding members make a 7-year commitment to realize their mission and vision of regeneration while upholding the commons’ values

The idea for a ReFi Commons takes inspiration from Eleanor Ostrom’s 8 Principles, Charles Eisenstein’s Sacred Economics and Brad Feld’s Startup Community Way. 

It is rooted in the belief that governments and corporations cannot solve climate change alone. 

We need a social movement that creates new economic models and provides an alternative to our extractive system.

WHAT DOES A REFI COMMONS DO?

While we recognize that regeneration looks differently according to the context, we believe there are a number of key behaviors that contribute to the three core objectives of a ReFi Commons. 

The key behaviors are:

1. Hold regular meetings and events
2. Create shared work spaces
3. Collaborate with other startup communities
4. Build in public
5. Support entrepreneurs and innovators

THE REFI COMMONS PRIZE 

The ReFi Commons Prize will be the genesis cohort of the ReFi Commons Incubator focused entirely on starting ReFi Commons in strategic local communities. 

It’s an opportunity for regens all around the world to submit proposals to become a ReFi Commons with the full support of ReFiDAO and Commons Stack with a strong core contributor team:

- Griff Green
- Tamara 
- Liviade
- Usama
- Daryl Edwards
- John Ellison

The genesis cohort will award prizes to three local ReFi Commons to implement an adapted Commons Stack framework in a strategic physical community over six months culminating in the launch of a governance token via an augmented bonding curve or other market mechanism. 

The first three Commons will be selected by a community-led governance process with details to follow.

The expectation is for each ReFi Commons to participate in the global ReFiDAO community and to provide a critical onramp of talent and capital to accelerate impact for people and the planet.

FINANCIALS

We are looking to raise $100k to cover operating expenditure for the ReFi Commons Prize for three months. This is half of the program, but there are some fixed up-front costs that reduces the overal expenditure. We need at least $75k to launch the program.

All funds raised will go towards the ReFi Commons Prize.

BEAR MARKET GRATITUDE
 
We have been so grateful to everyone in the Gitcoin community for their incredible support over the last 12 months. 

We will continue to steward the funds received with maximum capital efficiency, respecting the conditions of the market and the long-term horizon of the challenges at hand.

We are not building this startup movement for this cycle, or for next, but to see a global regenerative economy—and beyond.

REGENERATION FOR ALL 

Given that the vast majority of climate projects are rooted in the global south, we commit to a balanced representation of founders and communities supported through the ReFi Commons Incubator.

The vision of regeneration requires radical inclusion—especially for traditionally marginalized groups. We appreciate the Gitcoin community supporting us in this effort and are super excited to bring it to life!",https://refidao.com/,climateXcrypto,ReFiDAOist,Gitcoin grants,6,

Gitcoin support will enable support for IRL events establishing places of belonging for the ReFi Movement.
 
       Our Why?
 
Imagine a regenerative economy, a financial system that serves humanity and our collective home - Earth.
Within web3, the ReFi movement aims to cultivate this vision within a new economic system. ReFi Spring exists to support its emergence across a rich diversity of global networks by facilitating strong bonds between individuals through human IRL interaction. 
 
What does ReFi Spring do?
 
ReFi Spring is a nonprofit working to enable global IRL ReFi events to create new communities in the ReFi ecosystem. We do this by providing free, accessible, full-range event support services and educational content, including: 
 
How we do it
 
Event Toolkit: This toolkit contains all the information event organisers need to run a successful ReFi event, including event frameworks, marketing materials, tips for press engagement, workshop plans, and more.
 
Event Funding: Every ReFi event can apply for event funding; however, our funding criteria is weighted towards supporting events by and for marginalised communities. We recognise the importance of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion as fundamental values supporting the healthy growth of the ReFi ecosystem. 
 
Event Organizer Cohort: Providing upskilling sessions and the networking environment to grow the community of ReFi on-the-ground leaders.
 
Intro to ReFi Course: ReFi Spring is currently curating an “Intro to ReFi” online learning course for new and native audiences to understand and engage in the ReFi ecosystem. 

ReFi Rabbithole: Supporting the creation set of interconnected materials that explain what ReFi is to new audiences
 
We offer all of the above and so much more as a public good to the ReFi Community.
 
GR15 Update
 
Thanks to GR15 support, we enabled a further five events for a total of 27 events for Season 1 of ReFi Spring 
 
ReFi COP16 was series of talks, workshops, and panels addressing the use blockchain to increase the efficiency of the global fight against the climate emergency led by Regen Network at COP16.

ReFi Mercadito Verde - A ReFi Spring event focused on social currencies which promote a circular economy and a network of exchanges in Monteverde, Costa Rica.

ReFi India - A hugely successful first ReFi event in Bangalore, with over 100 participants and 15+ speakers.

ReFi Primavera Regenerativa - In Minas Gerais, Brazil, this event kicked off a season of meet-ups between web3 natives and agroforestry practitioners.

Descentraliza BH - The first Bankless Brazil IRL event introducing newbies to Web3 and Web3 natives to the ReFi movement, this was the first event to address ReFi in the city of Belo Horizonte in Minas Gerais, Brazil.

🌍 Bloom is a cyber-physical social network that helps people find and participate in grassroots climate actions where they live. https://bloomnetwork.earth

Today, we are 30,000 people on the ground in 22 local Bloom hubs across 9 countries doing rapid climate repair and adaptation.

👀 Problem

67% of people feel there is a climate emergency, but they don't know what they can do about it. Meanwhile, there are plenty of solutions happening on the ground, but they lack media visibility and funding, so they remain underground.

🌻 Solution

Local Bloom hubs connect existing projects in their region. They plant community gardens, teach people to form agroforestry co-ops, and build regional token economies focused on land and water stewardship. Online, we share knowledge P2P as a global community to implement climate repair more quickly and cost-effectively.

Here is a video produced by Diamante Bridge Collective, a local Bloom hub in Costa Rica. It tells the story of what's happening on the ground and how we use web3 to bridge the finance gap to local-led regeneration.

🌿 https://youtu.be/ENPt3lednAM

Bloom's social network is a vibrant hub for people to see the beautiful work happening around the planet, to flip mainstream narratives from fear to constructive, empowered action of caring for one another.

🌸🌸🌸 Our goal for 2023: Welcome 100 new local Bloom hubs. 🌸🌸🌸

What will we buidl with funds from this round?

Complete the social interactivity on Bloom Platform : Connect Unlock member NFT to our sign-in system : Pilot our local/international member fee splits to jumpstart local Blooms : Complete our cooperative/DAO formation with the help of an all-women legal team. This will reduce risk for our longstanding communities as we teach them to use cryptocurrency.

Since GR15:

We released the MVP of our multi-user blogging platform: regenerative action templates, action reporting (MRV), blogs, profiles, and automated local Bloom media feed pages. Lastly, our platform crew became an all-female team! 🙋🏽

🎬 Why Now

Local grassroots climate projects and Indigenous leaders have deep local ecosystem knowledge for how to repair soil, prevent deforestation, and reduce flooding risk. They are the key to accelerating climate action globally.

Why us 🙌🏽

Local Bloom organizers are master community builders, local food system stewards, and healers. Our tech team works with major television networks and dOrg.tech building DAO tooling. Lastly, our media team, based in Mumbai India, are creating the most wonderful graphics and communications from their experience as journalists and creatives!

         ---------         

The systems and institutions that got us into this mess will not get us out. The climate and biodiversity crises will be solved from the bottom up:  by People like you, Place by Place by Place, on Purpose.

TLDR

.basin is perpetual place-based climate and nature finance.

.basin scales land, ecosystem, and carbon sink restoration and conservation to solve the climate, nature, and carbon crises.

""RISK""

The crises we face are interconnected and not isolated from one another.  

Land-use change caused by development pressure has resulted in a decline of 69% in species populations since 1970. One million species, or 1 in 7, are now threatened with extinction, with another 40% in decline.  Simultaneously, if we fail to limit temperature increases, climate change will exacerbate biodiversity loss.

The climate and biodiversity crises have two main things in common: risk and land use.  Whether it be wildfires, flooding, heat, drought, habitat loss, income inequality, carbon sequestration, pollination, desertification, deforestation, etc, etc all pose serious risks to individuals, businesses, investors, and governments AND all interact with land in one way or another.

Historically, risk is not directly investable.  But land, and real estate, are.

INVESTABLE

.basin makes climate risk and nature loss risk investable through the use of tried and true real estate investment fundamentals to attract agnostic and indifferent capital into climate solutions, climate resilience, and climate adaptation.  

The .basin model combines law, technology, and finance to make climate and nature investable not only for institutional and private capital but also philanthropy.

CLIMATE & NATURE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT

Climate will be solved not only place by place by place but project by project by project.  The .basin protocol scales individual climate, carbon, and nature projects through shared upside and reduced risk.  

The .basin model of course works for forest projects but we take it several steps further to make projects that have enormous ecosystem service benefits (in addition to carbon) like wetlands, floodplains, peatlands, urban heat islands, estuaries, algae, biocrust, etc investable.  The .basin model also works for embodied carbon in buildings, the plugging of methane/gas leaks, and keeping oil and gas permanently in the ground.

RESTORATION & CONSERVATION

While the .basin model works for any property, regardless of size or location, the focus is on carbon sink and ecosystem restoration and conservation for maximum climate impact.

INDIVIDUAL & COLLECTIVE

The .basin model is designed to allow individuals to prosper while the collective flourishes. The flow of $STREAMS through $BASINS is a circular value exchange whereby collective success is only possible if individuals are successful and vice versa. All .basin's can be solely, jointly, or collectively managed.

SPEED & SCALE

The organizational and operational model of .basin is deployable, repeatable, and scalable for any place on earth and any type of ecosystem.  As a series of interrelated but independent entities .basin is built for both the challenges of today and the promise of tomorrow.  Our main entities are trust.basin, foundation.basin, dao.basin and a series of llc.basin's.

PLACE, PURPOSE & PEOPLE

Climate and nature can be (over)simplified to Place, Purpose, and People.  Each .basin represents a place, purpose, or person/people but each is deeply connected to the others.

PLACE:  as indicated by the name, .basin is primarily organized by watershed or basin.  This is similar to how humans have organized for thousands of years before we labeled nations and states. But .basin's can also be an ecosystem, your town, a place you visited, a place you care about.  We have even minted .basin's for individual trees.  Any point on the globe can be a .basin.  Examples: hudson.basin, indus.basin, flintriver.basin, congo.basin.

PURPOSE:  Just as we share common-place, we share common interests and common purpose.  This could be a cause you care about, a movement, a hobby or even a sport.  Most purpose .basin's are climate, nature and biodiversity focused. Examples: baldeagle.basin, beaver.basin, greensalamander.basin, wetlands.basin, carbon.basin, nature.basin.

PEOPLE: people are the connection points to place and purpose.  People are individuals, groups, organizations, companies, and even governments. Examples: tmo.basin, joebrewer.basin, will.basin, finley.basin, mckenna.basin

UNDER THE HOOD

All .basins are ERC-721 NFT’s energized with Charged Particles (@defiNFT).  All .basin's can store and hold any number and combination of ERC-20’s or NFT’s inside.  Many ERC-20's are yield bearing via Aave inside each .basin and can have time locks.

.basin's are a store of and fund what is truly valuable.  As perpetual purpose trusts and permanent endowments for natural capital and ecological assets .basin's hold financial value but also clean air, clean water, biodiversity, pollination, human health, and safety or any tokenized impact certificate.  The more value a .basin holds the more $STREAMS it receives.

$STREAMS

$STREAMS are the flows of value through the .basin ecosystem.  Technically they will be either a fungible ERC-20 or a semi-fungible ERC-1155.  $STREAMS are designed to incentivize positive outcomes and eliminate negative externalities.  $STREAMS are governance, access, and utility but also a flow of absolute value from trust.basin distributions.

The Barichara Regeneration Fund (BRF) supports the wholesale restoration of a 500,000-hectare territory in the Northern Andes of Colombia by developing and weaving together a network of individuals and organizations pursuing regenerative work on the individual, social, and ecological scale. Money received will be utilized to continue the ongoing work of the BRF to catalyze on-the-ground regenerative work in Barichara in service to the creation of a prototype of a bioregional regenerative economy that can be utilized worldwide.

Introduction
The town of Barichara, Colombia is uniquely positioned to cultivate large-scale regenerative work. Situated on a plateau, Barichara is at the center of a 500,000 hectare territory defined by its own regional climate system. The region possesses an incredibly unique ecosystem, the High-Andes tropical dry forest, that exists nowhere else on Earth with eighty percent of the species here being endemic, only existing in this territory. Unfortunately, the region has also seen intense monocrop agriculture, leaving only ten percent of the native forests intact. This, in turn, has led to soil degradation and erosion, the drying up of rivers, and the loss of the unique biodiversity of the territory.

What Has Been Accomplished 
We successfully raised $21,000 in the previous gitcoin round (GR15) and have made considerable progress in setting up a territorial foundation capable to oversee this territorial-scale regenerative work. This included hosting the #ReFiBarichara event in the first week of October that gathered like-minded people from the web3, crypto, and regenerative spaces.

Projects we are supporting include:
1.	 The Center for Syntropic Agroforestry to establish demonstration sites, train local farmers, and share technical knowledge about this powerful approach to reforestation and economic development.
2.	A community kitchen and store called Casa Comun that promotes the organic emergence of solidarity food exchanges while supporting local artists and craftspeople.
3.	A community reforestation project called Bioparque Móncora that is a highly visible symbol of peace, reforestation, and ecological education that works with area schools and national universities.
4.	The construction of a community theater called Canay Colibri where children learn the art of storytelling, filmmaking, and the performing arts – all in service to regeneration of the territory.
5.	The Barichara Ecoversity that is weaving educational activities throughout the region with a special focus on watershed restoration, preservation of native ecology, and how to create regenerative economies at the bioregional scale.

With funds that we raise during this gitcoin round, we will continue weaving a tapestry of local projects and sharing what we learn with the rest of the world through Barichara Updates and learning journeys.

Land and the Ecoversity
The BRF works to restore ecological health through a multifaceted strategy of weaving together current regenerative projects in Barichara, purchasing land for regenerative work, and creating groups and organizations to facilitate this work. Already, the BRF has raised $50,000 to purchase a heavily degraded plot of land, Origen del Agua, and has begun regenerative work on it.

Recently, the BRF has secured a second piece of land, Las Albercas, that will be the future home of the central campus of the Barichara Ecoversity. Here an off-grid campus will be created to provide on-the-ground training in various regenerative techniques such as permaculture, rainwater harvesting, renewable energy solutions, and syntropic agroforestry. The Barichara Ecoversity will serve as an integrating hub for both research and education in the territory with the Las Albercas campus serving as a place for experts and students to gather to teach and learn the skills needed for restoring planetary health, all while cultivating a deep connection to the land.

Syntropic Agroforestry
One of the central projects of the BRF has been spreading syntropic agroforestry throughout the territory. Syntropic agroforestry aims to foster climax ecosystems independent from outside inputs with an emphasis on plants geared towards maintaining food for human consumption. This works through the planting of food crops next to support species that aid with water retention, the fixing of nitrogen in the soils, the creation of shade, and the production of biomass to continually provide organic matter to cover the soil and enrich it over time. These methods encourage a process of ecological succession to occur as would happen in a natural process of forest expansion, just much faster and focused on supporting edible species. The process is one of syntropy with increased growth, diversity, density, and complexity throughout the entire system compared to conventional or organic agriculture.

The BRF has supported the creation of syntropic agroforestry projects throughout the territory. A syntropic agroforestry expert was brought to Barichara and has been teaching local farmers within the region. Specifically, two three-day design classes on syntropic agroforestry have been offered, giving participants a technical explanation of the principles of the technique and then hands-on instruction through the creation of two field sites. The demand for syntropic agroforestry has been great in the territory, and our aim is to continue supporting those wanting to learn on their journey towards transitioning to regenerative food production.

Other Work
The work of the BRF is constantly evolving in relation to what is emerging on the ground in Barichara.

A community council was set up to coordinate regenerative action in the territory with funds from the BRF being used to support fifteen local projects in the community, greatly facilitating the development of relationships among these projects in the territory.
As its successor, we are in the process of creating a Territorial Foundation to formally facilitate the reception of funds and mediate their use in a process ensuring consent and support from the local community.

All these efforts combine to form a cohesive and self-reinforcing Bioregional Investment Platform where the individuals and organizations dedicated to regeneration cyclically flow value amongst each other, creating a consistent spinning out of social and ecological value for the entire territory. With your help, the BRF aims to support this ever-evolving process of territorial regeneration.

Next steps for the BRF
The work of the BRF has been ongoing for nearly three years, and much has been accomplished in that time. The relationships developed through this work and the land that has been acquired has given the BRF the foundation on which to pivot to long-term strategic planning to ensure the holistic restoration of the entire territory. One of our partners and collaborators, Commonland Foundation, has created a landscape investment framework currently utilized by fifteen territories around the world.

Their model is a five-step, twenty-year process to produce a self-sustaining regenerative economy, geared towards social and ecological improvement. Key to the success of this model is the formation of a core team with enough funds to dedicate themselves completely to this work all throughout the twenty-year period. This initial investment in a core team provides the supports necessary to ensure that the work reaches maturity, and a regenerative economy can form and begin to sustain the entire territory. This core team is currently in development and will continue the work of the ongoing regenerative projects in the area.

The development and funding of this core team forms one of three major funding efforts for the BRF. The second is the funding and construction of the Ecoversity, described above, and the third, the support of the current regenerative projects in the area. These three overarching projects will allow us to move towards holistic landscape regeneration at a bioregional scale. In total, this amounts to raising $500,000 in the next year to accelerate this work. The funds gathered through the Gitcoin grant round will be directed towards this purpose.

Bioregional Activators
We created a new community platform called Bioregional Activators to create a planetary network of regenerative economies – sharing what we learn from projects in Barichara to help other landscapes around the world. 

This includes activating four bioregions in the Central Rockies that are all located in Colorado; an upcoming trip to Toronto and the Finger Lakes of New York to help form alliances among bioregions in the Great Lakes Region, and growing interest to have us work with landscapes in British Colombia, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica.

Vision
All the activities of the BRF are in service to the creation of a real-world prototype of a regenerative bioregional economy. By weaving those that are on the ground, purchasing strategic pieces of land, integrating Web3 tools to monitor change in ecological health, and being continually open to new collaborative relationships as they arrive, the BRF intends to lay the groundwork for others to follow in their own territories. We hope that with the success of this model in Barichara, it can be used as a prototype worldwide and help regenerate the planet through regenerating local communities.

Learn More
BRF community council member Joe Brewer has made the effort to document its progress to English speaking audiences. He has formulated his thoughts on the process in his book, The Design Pathway for Regenerating Earth, and founded the Earth Regenerators network, a diverse platform with over 4,000 participants dedicated to restoring planetary health, to spread the model developed here, while learning from others’ experiences. He and others from Barichara regularly provide updates on their progress in videos and articles on the network.

✨ OVERVIEW ✨

At ReCommon, our mission is to facilitate the reclamation and stewardship of common land by supporting the emergence of resilient place-based communities and regenerative economies. To achieve this, we leverage regenerative financial infrastructure and innovative governance frameworks to secure communally stewarded lands for both current and future generations to thrive on.

ReCommon draws inspiration from three foundational pillars: the Community Land Trust model of land tenure, ecological design, and distributed technologies. When woven together, these three pillars of thought pose a viable alternative to the current extractive paradigm of land use and ownership that is destroying the ecological systems we need to survive and thrive here on planet Earth.

This particular model of land tenure is both new and old, a mix of time-honored principles and modern wisdom. Our organization is a catalyst for both global and local communities to rise to the unique challenges of our times and emerge into a new era of abundance and connectedness.

""The story of land is older than the story of man. Land came first; no man created it. Every society, large or small, must devise ways in which its members will share this gift. This is allocation. Members of the society must also determine under what conditions the land will be passed on to the next generation. This is continuity. And they must decide if, when, and how it may be traded with others. This is exchange."" - Robert Swann

ReCommon is creating an equitable land tenure framework for democratically managing the intricately connected processes of allocation, continuity, and exchange. It's a scalable, adaptable model that enables people to balance land wealth in private control with the needs of the community and the Earth for regenerative, perpetual stewardship of land.

⛰ THE COMMONS CREDIT ⛰

The Commons Credit is a whole-systems accounting and valuation methodology for community-held land.

It serves two primary functions. The first is to properly value any given piece of land, including the ecosystem health, economic capacity, housing, food production, etc. The second is to create a way for ethical investors to finance the purchase of land and get a return on their investment while keeping the ownership within a perpetual trust and stewardship within the community.

Those who invest in ‘Commons Credits’ are considered Patrons, representing 20 percent of voting power on both the global ReCommon level and on the Bioregional Node level, depending on the origination of the commons credit.

The Commons Credit serves as the digital record of a piece of land that is in the ReCommon network. When a piece of land enters a Bioregional Node’s stewardship, a Commons Credit is created as the digital representation of the value of that land at that moment and is forever tethered to that piece of land.

As regenerative practices and community infrastructure are put into place, they increase the wholistic value of the land, which is concurrently recorded and updated in the commons credit, using a smart-contract NFT such as Charged Particles. This ongoing assessment is the whole-systems valuation methodology, and as MRV (measurement, recording, and verification) tools improve over time, the rate at which this assessment happens will trend towards nearly live updates.

The Commons Credit becomes a way to finance community-centered land regeneration by serving as the fertile middle ground between philanthropic donation and conventional real estate investment.

The Patron who purchases a commons credit for a particular piece of land doesn’t own that land, which is owned by the bioregional node’s trust, but they are included in both governance and upside in the appreciation of the value of that land.

The value of the commons credit tracks with the holistic evaluation of that piece of land, which will increase through regenerative use and sustainable development. When the land value goes up, it is reflected in the Commons Credit, and the Patron (the holder of the Commons Credit) can choose to sell it on the open market for profit.

🏛 GOVERNANCE MODEL 🏛

At the core of our work, we create tools to reclaim, protect, and regenerate land through the use of the Regenerative Community Land Trust (RegenCLT) model of land tenure and governance.

The RegenCLT model is designed to lower barriers to entry for communities seeking to acquire land through purchase or gift and to develop a permaculture master plan for the site. This place-based plan takes into account the current state of the land, its future uses, its connection to the local and regional economy and community, and the global community at large.

The RegenCLT model is uniquely capable of acquiring all types of land, returning it to the commons, and stewarding it sustainably for future generations.

Governance power is shifted from an elected board of directors to the community of members directly, similar to the distributed governance of digital communities like DAOs.

We combine a ‘one-person, one-vote' system with the ‘balanced bucket' structure used by classic CLT boards. The result is that each person has a vote, and each vote goes through a weighted bucket system that directly corresponds to how that voter is connected with the land or project in question.

These are the 5 voting buckets, each with equal categorical weight:
- General Members (20%) - people that are members but don’t belong to any delineated subgroup
- Stewards (20%) - leaseholders of land in trust in the ReCommon network
- Elders (20%) - rights of nature representatives and holders of indigenous wisdom
- Patrons (20%) - financial investors and holders of Commons Credits
- Partners (20%) - partner organizations that provide resources and support in various forms

ReCommon follows this governance structure on a global level, and as such anyone can participate. However, each Bioregional Node also follows this structure on a local level.

To be a member of a Bioregional Node and participate in governance, one must live in that particular bioregion. This leverages the network effects that come from global connectivity while honoring the specificity of place and putting local decision-making first.

Additionally, Bioregional Nodes may choose to adapt and modify this 5 bucket model to the unique needs and characteristics of their bioregional community.

🌲 WHAT’S A COMMUNITY LAND TRUST? 🏘

All community land trusts strike the balance between project organizer, developer, and steward. Fortunately enough, the community land trust is a community development tool of uncommon flexibility that can accommodate a wide variety of land uses and development projects. Over the decades since the idea first came to fruition, community land trusts have been pushing the limits of what is possible with this governance framework.

At ReCommon we are continuing the evolution of the community land trust, integrating decentralized governance and regenerative cryptoeconomics to improve upon existing models.

The community land trust movement started with radical roots and was part of the ‘back to the land and village’ revival movements of the 1960s that pursued justice, equality, freedom, and resilient local communities.

However, in recent years the movement has taken a turn toward affordable low-income housing. This work is undoubtedly a critical component, but alone it’s not enough to address the complexity of the systemic problems of our time. In many ways, ReCommon embodies a return to the spirit found in the roots of the community land trust movement.

dMeter is creating a decentralized monitoring, reporting and verification (dMRV) system. We are in the beginning of this dMRV process and countless building blocks are still missing. There will be problems and limitations that we encounter, but as these gradually get addressed it will become possible to use this new set of lego building blocks to build things that we can hardly imagine today.

A.  MRV (monitoring, reporting, and verification) overview

MRV consists of three distinct features, all of which are vital to conveying legitimacy of regenerative projects (such as tree planting) to stakeholders. Monitoring is the process of measuring the total ecosystem and social services provided by the project. Measurements may be collected through satellite, IOT, georeferenced imagery from boots on the ground, as well as surveys that empower experts & citizen scientists. Reporting involves describing i) measured data, ii) the methodologies that were used to collect and analyze the data, and iii) potential biases as well as assumptions that went into the data collection/analysis. Verification refers to the review process involving a third party that is utilized to ensure the confidence in the validity of the uploaded data and methodologies.

Decentralized measurement, reporting and verification (dMRV) means that no single entity will own, manage or regulate how MRV is done. Instead a collective of people from many different organizations can build upon and improve this dMRV system. For current accreditation standards a combination of on the ground data collection, satellite sensing and IOT devices are used to back the credits. Utilizing web3 mentality, trust minimized data collection methods can be created. An example of this is to write open codes for actions that used to be performed by humans, like detecting a tree and the species of tree it is. Other data collection technologies can become integrated into this system as they become standard in the future.

Once the data is collected, open source reporting and verification methodologies can be utilized to analyze the data. Entities that collect the data and create the analysis methodologies are paid each time data is used and an analysis done. This inspires entrepreneurs to build specialized dMRV services which can benefit further regenerative projects. The entire dMRV allows for standardization, trustlessness, immutability, transparency, and open accessibility. This paves the way for decentralized data backed credits. These credits are tied to a specific regenerative action and entity who carried out the action continuously updated over time as more data is gathered. This data and the methodologies used to analyze it is stored permanently and immutably. The collectors of this data are the owners of it, allowing for sensitive data to be fully controlled by its owner. The dMRV would assist regenerative projects across blockchains and be interoperable with any new blockchain that came into existence. Every entity that is involved with this dMRV helps to iteratively improve upon it. With this, local communities can become more deeply involved with how the regenerative projects they carry out go through the dMRV process as well as tap into funding that was not previously available to carry out these projects. Along with that the diversity and veracity of Natural Capital assets being valued can exponentially increase.

Monitoring 
 
In this dMRV everything is open to where there is only one final layer of trust- the data itself. Trust minimized data collection can be done through a combination of remote sensing, IoT, and human sensing (such as with smart-phones). The data collected is stored permanently and immutably through current technology such as Filecoin Green. By multiple data sources backing up that a regenerative action has occurred, more accurate calculations can be created. When one of those inputs is inaccurate, the other data sources can openly show a dispute. When a dispute arises, the stakeholders of the dMRV system can confirm or deny the accuracy of the data. Scoring this data for quality, resolution, and temporal frequency can enable any entity utilizing the dMRV to compare the data sources they pay for. Allowing them to quickly choose the best dataset for their needs. Through this, data becomes highly available as many organizations strive to provide the best data for people’s needs. This puts publishers on a level playing field and allows the companies with the best data to naturally succeed. Along with that publishers can not only benefit from the dMRV utilizing the data but other organizations that might want their data (such as parametric insurance). When individuals can decide who gets access to their data, they can ensure it is used ethically. They can also willingly give access to their data to those attempting to create good causes.

 Reporting and Verification

 Reporting and verification utilize algorithms. Algorithms are a set of instructions followed to solve a problem or accomplish a task (types of algorithms include standard, machine learning and AI). They are used to process data or information. For example georeferenced imagery can be analyzed using an algorithm that detects if a tree is present in that imagery. Another example is an algorithm can choose which data sources are the most appropriate for evaluating a regenerative action based upon how these data sources did previously. This is more efficient than a human could do, reducing the dMRV costs.

 Previous MRV organizations have developed their own algorithms. Some of these algorithms are open source and will become part of the dMRV system if there is no conflict with the creators in doing so. Oftentimes it is only the MRV organization that developed the algorithm that uses it. Allowing more entities to utilize the MRV algorithm, “algorithms-as-a-service” (AaaS) have arisen as a business model. AaaS allows entities of very small to large financial backing to benefit  from them.  For example, a small business might not have the resources to hire a data scientist to build and train a machine learning model or maintain the infrastructure needed to store the data that the model would be trained on. However, with AaaS, they can simply subscribe to a service and use the algorithms that have been created by someone else. Now through decentralization, algorithm providers can offer their services in a trust minimized and automated way. Along with that they can help financially support the providers of the data that was used to train that algorithm, which in turn gives data providers an incentive to provide high-quality and unique data that otherwise wouldn’t be available for training. Algorithmic transparency allows regenerative actions to demonstrate the ecosystem services they provide in a trustless, decentralized and immutable manner. Which in turn will attract more ReFi investors to support these actions. The more funding that gets channeled towards regenerative actions, the more the dMRV system is used and with each iteration it improves.

 Infrastructure

 In order to host the data and distribute money to creators of algorithms, among other components of the dMRV system, decentralized infrastructure needs to be created. To permanently store the data collected, decentralized storage systems need to be utilized. For distributing that data to entities that would like to purchase it, data markets need to adequately display it. A new distributed system needs to be created for analyzing that data and paying for each time an analysis methodology is utilized. Some of these systems exist, however they can be improved upon to further support the dMRV system.

 Domain Experts

 For each regenerative action type there are domain specialists. For example an ocean scientist is unlikely to know how to appropriately value tree planting, vice versa. In order to develop analysis algorithms appropriate to each regenerative action type, this specialized knowledge needs to be brought into the dMRV system.

 As these domain experts are the ones likely to start creating tokens from the dMRV system (onboarding non web3 regenerative actions into this space) it is encouraged that a percent of their revenue goes towards supporting the dMRV system and if able provide grants for supporting the initial start of this. These organizations will not have control of the dMRV treasury.

Revenue Sources
This dMRV system will be created bottom up from individuals and software, these individuals are who we aim to get rewarded through this software system. The flow of this system is planned to be as follows. An entity pays for collection of data, entities affiliated with this dMRV system collect the data using techniques that are part of this system. The data goes to decentralized storage which is paid for, then the entity that pays for the data is able to access it. The data is interpreted via methodologies either that the entity has proprietary control over or that is open source and part of the dMRV system. If the method is open source, a donation is channeled to the creators of the method for its use. The collected data is also marketed in a data marketplace, when people use the data they pay for the use of it. This payment goes towards both the marketplace and the data creator.

Some of the business cases for dMRV are 
dMRV setup as a service
Restoration project strategy for insurers
Ecosystem risk area assessment, regeneration plan, and MRV for insurers, municipalities, and eco-tourism enterprises
Environmental Asset Creation- Carbon Credits

Here are some empathy maps showcasing what each business case may be thinking- https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVP9wfNe8=/ 

Cross Organizational Support
Behind all of this are people. These people have formed their own decentralized organizations specializing in different aspects of the dMRV system. There are organizations specializing in data collection, analysis and domain experts. The organizations participating in the dMRV will continue to expand as the system builds continued support.

Here’s a complete map of the organizations that are part of dMeter: https://mm.tt/map/2252789449?t=NhUfVodAtw 

B. dMeter organizational structure

The Principles that dMeter Operates By Is:

Legitimacy
We build with integrity, with high standards for quality of data and mindfulness with how it’s collected. We build legitimacy with the communities, stakeholders, and internal contributors involved by striving for alignment of our highest intentions with the day-to-day working processes that move our work forward.

Transparency of Process
When facilitating data collection, making decisions, or building tools, we provide clear documentation of how it was done, enabling people to understand what went into a specific action, decision, or strategy. In this process we aim to be as holistic as possible. 

Collaborative interoperability
Data infrastructure needs to be highly interoperable so individuals can take their data with them and use it in different ecosystems, technologies, and use-cases. We create space for collaboration between organizations and focus on the standards that enable interoperability for ecodata.

Distributed & decentralized
We distribute and decentralize power. There is no top-down hierarchy in dMeter where you answer to a boss. We self-organize around our strategy and allow leadership to organically arise from the recognition of valuable contributions by the community. We hold ourselves accountable to dMeter as a community and dMRV as a movement, not any individual. Along with that we empower systems that enable anyone anywhere to collect and provide data to the system in a trust minimized way. 

Clear Responsibility & Accountability
We take initiative to define our responsibilities given our role and desires in dMeter, and hold ourselves accountable to these responsibilities on a day-to-day basis. We support each other to take responsibility and accountability by doing it in our own workflow and communications.

The Solar Foundation’s mission is to fund solar to under-served communities in emerging markets and developing economies. We want to reinvent the non-profit and NGO model using the tools of web3 to create a new funding model. The new model will help underserved communities access clean energy and have an ownership stake in the solar deployed in their community. The Solar Foundation will fund these projects through donations, micro-loans, and other funding models. Public goods should empower communities; we believe access to electricity is a public good! Our long-term goal is to transfer 100% of the ownership to the communities we serve. 

Update

Since GR15, our focus at the Solar Foundation has been on helping Ayowecca Uganda, a fellow Gitcoin Grantee in need of solar, to help improve the safety, security, and efficiency of its community-based agroforestry NGO. Ayowecca has made two project requests: 1. Solar lights for the Ayowecca tree nursery; 2. Solar + Storage for critical power needs at their office. We’ve consulted with Ayowecca to determine their needs and how we can best help and have sent crypto to fund the solar lights for the tree nursery. The lights will be purchased from and installed by a local solar installer. 

For the Ayowecca office, we learned that the organization is hoping to move to a new office next year, so ideally, the solar solution should be mobile. We have been researching mobile solar solutions and exploring a potential partnership with the Footprint Project (footprintproject.org).  We hope to pursue a mobile solution that would meet Ayowecca’s needs and provide workforce training and a new source of revenue for the community. We are also working with Footprint Project in Puerto Rico where we will be helping to find some of their work as a part of our GR15 funding commitments.

Problem

Climate change is an existential threat to humanity. The people most affected are in low-income and developing communities. They have directly suffered the most from dirty energy and industry. Electricity is an essential public good that drives economic growth, improves living standards, and alleviates poverty. We aspire to give this good back to the people. Many organizations have been working to solve this complex problem. If a centralized utility company tried to solve the problem, they would construct large fossil fuel-burning power plants and then build a grid of power lines to connect to customers. They would also keep all of the production and infrastructure ownership. This infrastructure does not exist in the parts of the world where energy poverty is an issue. Building traditional power plants and power grids is slow and costly, and the environmental impacts of creating this infrastructure are high. They would significantly contribute to furthering the devastation of climate change. 

Solution

We believe a decentralized approach will be required to solve this problem. Instead of large centralized entities burning coal and other fossil fuels, the Solar Foundation will build localized small solar microgrids and individual systems. These microgrids can supply power to small communities as close to the end-user as possible. Web3 has evolved and can provide the tools necessary to build new funding mechanisms (using the power of DeFi) so that we can focus on funding solar projects. Our vision is to create a foundation that can provide tax efficiency to donors and fund vital solar projects worldwide. Ownership, payments, and system monitoring can all be on the blockchain. This level of transparency, accountability, and ownership will empower the communities we serve. A collaborative approach is essential to solving this problem. We seek to form a strong coalition of web3 and ReFi projects and bring the voices of the communities we serve into the conversation. We will work with local installers to help us install solar to support local economies and continue to support the projects long term so that they have an impact for years to come.

Avano is a proud member of Panvala League. Donations in PAN are much appreciated and can help us access additional matched funding. You can get PAN here: https://app.1inch.io/#/1/unified/swap/DAI/PAN. Avano is also a verified organization on Giveth. Donations on Giveth are much appreciated https://giveth.io/project/return-to-green 

The original idea of Avano (our old name was Akorn) is presented here in an intro video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqbmqB3unuI. Since then our work has been separated into two primary sections. Firstly, furthering the creation of a decentralized monitoring, reporting and verification system (dMRV). Secondly, empowering synergistic emergence for public good, through art and web3. After the name of each of our sub orgs you can find the percent of funds that will be channeled from funds raised in this round. 

The Avano DAO wiki can be found here: https://avano.gitbook.io/avano/avano and we readily share what we are up to through our Twitter. To check out other projects in the ReFi ecosystem, check out this map we created and feel free to add your organization: https://www.mindmeister.com/map/2145029803?t=AiP70N5AmZ

Decentralized Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (dMRV) Systems: dMeter 20% of Funds https://dmeter.super.site/ 

75% of funds raised from GR14 by Avano were channeled into a shared treasury initiating dMeter. dMeter is one of the first organizations of its kind. It is an organization of organizations that incentivizes cross organizational (decentralized) collaboration for monitoring, reporting and verification. This dMRV system is particularly geared towards data collection of regenerative actions (such as tree planting) and the benefits from them (such as benefits to water, soil, air, etc.). To further support dMeter’s growth 25% of funds raised by Avano from GR15 were channeled to dMeter. Now 50% of the funds raised from this grant round (GR16), will go towards furthering the newly established Desci branch of dMeter.

Art and Public Good: Return to Green 20% of Funds Raised https://linktr.ee/returntogreen 

The first ReFi Metaverse event raised 5.3 eth for environmental organizations on Giveth. Organizations responded that this funding allowed them immensely; they established a recycling center in El Salvador and doubled their treasury budget in Brazil for example. There was a full day of ReFi talks (recorded on our Youtube: https://youtu.be/8C3ya7dNulc) from leaders all over the world. Music was streamed into the metaverse from two different stages (12 hours each stage) and 52 NFTs from 40+ artists were auctioned for the environment! 

From the success of this event a following event was coordinated for September 9th in New Zealand around Mental Health as a public good. There was a custom metaverse space created for a Gender neutral, identity fluid, artist that is a DAO to portray their current work as well as stream the opening exhibition event into the metaverse. This event sent .18ETH to PeepTers, Sage to Saddle, Gravity DAO, and Happy DAO from NFTs sold during the event. Check out the space here: https://www.voxels.com/play?coords=N@4665W,2194S 

To further support linguistic diversity in the crypto space, Return to Green hosted EthSantiago in their custom built boiler room space. This conference was entirely in Spanish. https://www.voxels.com/play?coords=W@2957W,3936N,0.5U 

Collaborated with AgroforestDAO to teach school children in Brazil how to build metaverse space and how planning in the metaverse can be useful for agroforestry principles. Can see the result of the collaboration here: https://www.voxels.com/play?coords=N@5196W,1814N

Public Good NFT Marketplace: FeNXT NFT Marketplace 60% of Funds Raised

From the efforts of Return to Green, the need for an NFT marketplace that supports public good projects on Giveth was identified. Raid Guild was contracted for a design sprint of this marketplace After the design sprint was completed the results were shared on various forums of organizations that support public good. With the word getting out that we were wanting to start fundraising to create an MVP of this marketplace we were approached by Inverter Network a branch of PrimeDAO, asking if we were interested in being one of the first web3 organizations to utilize their newly created fundraising system. We were very intrigued and are now going to be part of their trial run in February. Can learn more about this marketplace here: https://gov.charged.fi/t/fenxt-nft-marketplace

—---------------
🪧 Summary 
—--------------
Endangered Tokens is a ReFi NFT community looking to revalue biodiversity by tokenizing endangered trees with web3 incentives and digital value added.

( To see a rich text and full version of the grant description go to:  https://hackmd.io/@vrXnknFqSEq7faTi-zgdxw/r1DIJgDys )

—-----------
Mission & Vision
—---------
Form a decentralized investment community for Endangered Species and life preservation, giving value and governance to stakeholders through Crypto Assets. 

We believe in a decentralized future where economies are driven by independent, sustainable and healthy ecosystems in which the community collabore adding value to accomplish complex tasks. We need to  revalue biodiversity and living ecosystems through preservation of Endangered Species which are invaluable assets to the world. 
—------------------------
🤔 Why support us? 
—------------------------

😵‍💫Problem to Solve

🌳Endangered trees are responsible for maintaining the health of most of the world's endangered forest ecosystems, but rarely produce relevant revenue for landowners (without being damaged) and even become financial liabilities, thus encouraging their illegal felling. 



👌Endangered Tokens’ Solution

Leverage web3 and digital art to incentivize the protection of these scarce beings by changing their status from merely the cost of maintaining a tree to a revenue producing Bio-Asset. 🌏

—------------------------------------
🤷‍♂️ How will we accomplish this?
—------------------------------------



Endangered Tokens is a ReFi & DeSci NFT community looking to revalue biodiversity by tokenizing georeferenced endangered trees. Each specimen is characterized and video recorded alongside a small verse description, and when owning one, you become the godfather of a scarce endangered tree! 😊

With the funds raised we will help landowners finance the protection of endangered Forest with reforestation, verification of carbon credits from the forests and the creation of quality digital content & data to add value to the tokens, content like:

-3D tourism experience of the protected forests thus reducing the footprint of real life tourism while also generating a continuous flow of revenue to keep supporting the protection of the forests. 
-Using the 3D replicas of each tree as a virtual asset for video games and/or augmented reality experiences
-Recording data from the forest for research and enhanced digital experiences like music from the frequencies of the trees, bioacoustics, video recording of the ecosystems, climate data, water flow, among other relevant information.


NFT holders will receive a portion of the revenue that will come from the NFT Sales, tourism experiences, data management and carbon credits, thus converting endangered trees from liabilities to biodiversity assets for the future. 



—---------------------------------------------------
🌳Which kind of trees are we talking about?
—--------------------------------------------------

We are currently working in Chile in South America, with the rare species Gomortega Keule (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomortega), or locally known as Queule. These magnificent beings are the last one of the Gomortegacae Family, dating its evolution to Pangea times. It is estimated that there are no more than 4000 specimens alive in the world! (Scarcer than Bitcoin!)

*️⃣Ex-situ conservation actions and landscape restoration actions
*️⃣Sustainable local development & community engagement
*️⃣Research on species and their habitats
*️⃣Carbon Bonds verification, trading and retirement

4️⃣.-Marketing and community building

We have realized that a crypto community needs to be active, engaged and in constant growth in order to stay healthy. This is an important pillar of investment on top of a marketing lead within the team.

5️⃣.- Biodiversity Assets Research & Development

In order to fully convert our protected trees to biodiversity Assets we think a proper indicator with a Minimum Reliable Verification (MRV) of the health status of the trees and species must be accomplished. In order to achieve this we will foster a DeSci project that aims to gather Bio-Acoustic data from different forests with different conditions and generate a machine learning algorithm that can automatically diagnose the living conditions within an ecosystem. 

—-------------------------------------------------
🖼️State of the art & ongoing projects
—------------------------------------------------

☸️The Tokents: Digital assets with ReFi purpose

We are creating NFT collections that help us fundraise and add value to our community. So far we have launched 2 collections: 

#️⃣Elder ENTS NFT: Georreferenced tokenized Specimens of Endangered Trees. 
    * 1st Collection Gomortega Keule - Elder ENT Queule# : **Founders Collection** 

Become one of the **founder members circle** of the project by minting one.

#️⃣Entrees NFT: 
  * 1st Collection CryptoKeules - Entrees CK# : Artist Diegong 



The final visualization of our Preserve to Earn ecosystem includes 2 ERC Tokens to Interact with the NFTS:

* #### $ENTS DAO Governance Token - Fungible ERC20 to vote in DAO discussions and other ReFi/DeFi applications 

* #### $ROOTS utility Token - Fungible ERC20 to use within dapp functions and utilities.



☸️🌳🌳🌳The Queule 3D virtual Experience🌳🌳🌳

Using Unreal Engine 5 we have modeled so far 10 of the 25 tokenized Queules. The first product that is ready-to-launch from this is the Queule 3D showroom to explore the modeled trees as a virtual experience. 
We are developing a Virtual Reality Experience of the Endangered Queule Forest as a product to offer to our holders and also to Scale our ReFi Model. 


☸️🎵🎶🎵Music of the ENTS🎵🎶🎵

Alongside the virtual experience we are recording the frequencies of the endangered trees through a PlantsPlay device (www.plantsplay.com) as the first approach. Our vision is to be able to stream the music of the endangered trees live, so they can produce their own content to help them stay alive.


☸️  DeSci projects to be developed 🧪


# Bio-Acoustic MRV
In order to understand the forest better, we need to learn how its sounds speaks regarding the health of the forest.This way we will be able to use a cheap and effective MRV for our forests and contribute to the ReFi community with more tools and infrastructure for better MRVs


# Dendrochronology of long lived trees to understand climate change.

With the proper tools and scientific professionals measuring the age of long lived trees and its roots can help us understand more about their endangered situation. 

# Queule Frog studies 🐸
Frogs are very important bioindicators of the forest. There is a rare frog that only lives nearby Queule forests and we are already researching regarding their behavior and ways to protect them.

Regens Unite DAO is a coalition of people on a mission to build public goods and create a network with and for regens. We consider everyone building regenerative solutions for themselves, for our communities and for the planet at large, a regen.🌱

👉🏼 We organised several of “Regens Unite” IRL events and full week retreats in Brussels, Berlin (video), Amsterdam, Bogota to bring together people working on regenerative solutions for themselves, communities and the planet. And we wrote a handbook as a source for decentralised Regens Unite events.

👉🏼 New events are planned in Amsterdam, Brussels (April, May and August) and Berlin (September) in the coming year, and we are working on regenerative offers to other DAOs. And we wrote a handbook as a source for decentralised regen events.

👉🏼 Our next step in building the infrastructure
Next step in accommodating the fast growing community is the development of a proper common website for the Regens Unite community, with a shared calendar and newsletter to facilitate the discovery of regen events, practices and knowledge. 

🙏🏽For this we need your support.🙏🏽


🍀 What do Regens need to Unite?

Regens realise that there is no single silver bullet, no one-size-fits-all solution. It will take many different initiatives, many different projects, many different communities. That’s why, instead of convincing each other, learning how to relate will be a key factor in joining forces to build viable solutions. We need to come out of our bubbles.

That is why  🌱we need to unite🌱, we need to get to know each other, build trust and help each other be as successful as possible in building solutions.

Regens Unite is a fresh way of bringing Regens together in real life, to build a strong web between all the different types of regenerative sectors, both in and outside of web3, so that we can learn from each other and foster new avenues of collaboration & unification. 

Our in-person events bring together regenerative thinkers and doers in DAOs, ReFi, DeSci, Platform Coops, Purpose Organizations, Climate Activism, NGOs, and Art to co-create & share projects, knowledge, food, kindness and hope.

🍀 What are Regen Unite events like? 

People have expressed awe and surprise by whom they’ve met and by the different approach Regens Unite events have taken. Regens Unite events are not typical conferences. No powerpoints, no convincing each other of solutions, but uniting in our common goal: regenerate ourselves, regenerate how we communicate & collaborate, and regenerate the planet.

These unconference-style events include:
⭕️ Facilitated workshops
⭕️ Round circle discussions
⭕️ Co-creation spaces
⭕️ Relaxation areas

Some of the reactions we received in the feedback form on the question ‘what surprised you?’

✨ Solid female presence, and people who didn’t know what web 3 was (YES)
✨ I was positively surprised, that not only people from crypto world attended
✨ The leaning into regeneration as a personal, interpersonal human need as well as environmental regeneration


🍀 How can we help your community?

We have developed an expertise in organising conferences where people can make new meaningful connections and feel rejuvenated. We learned how to create safe and brave spaces where people can meet other people outside of their bubble.

We can put that expertise of service to your community, to help you organise a Regens Unite Hub at your conference, a Regen Retreat, or find ways to bring more diversity to your community.


🍀 What’s next for Regens Unite?

There is a reason that greenpilling is such a strong movement: the understanding that we do not want to recreate current global system imbalances by building in a silo. We need to build bridges, we need to connect to our neighbours and to offline communities.

There is a lot more potential in the ideas behind Regens Unite. We are now organising to become a DAO to help each other create those spaces where Regens can unite in every city and every region.

Our goal is to facilitate more events in 2023, produce great content around the movement, and help Regens unite around the world. Every donation helps us to move this mission forward!

/////////////// 🏃‍♂️TL;DR  ////////////////

//// ⚡️♻️ WHY SUPPORT THE RENEWABLE ENERGY BUNDLE 


Energy is the 👉 biggest problem of the Climate Crisis 👈 
since its consumption is responsible for 75.6% of all global CO2 emissions 🤯
 
These projects are working hard to 📉 reduce emissions and create new ways to increase the adoption of renewable energy in its many forms.


We are focused on directly funding renewable energy development around the world while creating decentralized energy grids and data centers that heat spaces with compute power instead of wasting energy on cooling. This removes middle men, makes climate action programmable, improves access to stable electricity and accelerates the world’s transition to sustainable energy and heating.

If you want to put your chips on a sector that is e-x-i-s-t-e-n-t-i-a-l and fundamental for solving climate change, it would be this.

Time is running out. Climate research today needs to focus immediately on practical solutions. We need research that leads to mass movements and exponentially growing impact. Like the US Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E), the Climate Research bundle will be a key engine of climate innovation and climate action. While fixing our sights on the high bar set by ARPA-E is wildly ambitious, we know that blockchain technology can exponentially increase effective and efficient scientific research. Integrated indicators make the research replicable and scalable and allow improved documentation and verification. The ambitious and innovative projects in the Climate Research bundle will architect many systems of the new infrastructure of climate research and scientific collaboration. 

This bundle is comprised of 8 critical and interrelated projects address various challenges of climate research by generating:

⚡ Clean, cheap, abundant, and reliable sources of energy and the need to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on cities and urban areas.

💨 Increased speed and efficiency of traditional methods for conducting and translating scientific research

🤯 Solutions to the complex set of root causes that contribute to the long time it takes for scientific research to be implemented in real life

🔍 Increased transparency, traceability, and access to funding for scientific research

🦾 Effective mechanisms to protect intellectual property, reduced investor risk in, and increased investor access to the scientific and technological innovation process

🤑 Profitable ways for companies to align with community values related to climate change

🔬 More effective research, and strategies for promoting and supporting scientific innovation that positively impacts the world and its inhabitants

🌱 Developing regenerative data tech, storing digital data in the DNA of plants and trees, to create carbon absorbing data storage

🌎 Grow Your Own Cloud DAO (GYOC DAO)

FrontierDAO @FrontierDAO;  Collectively incubating scientific and engineering innovations and innovators, using Web3 tooling (linktr.ee/frontierdao).

One of our key focus areas is “fusion energy as a climate solution.” Fusion energy, while still in its infancy, is the technology that will usher in a new era on this planet - one where cheap, clean, abundant, baseload energy is available for all. 

Nuclear fusion energy is the energy of the stars and sun. It is the opposite of nuclear fission.. 

To help usher in this new era of transition to clean energy, FrontierDAO has released in BETA an IP NFT on-chain scientific publishing platform called FrontierRegistry. By publishing research on the blockchain, we aim to foster greater collaboration while protecting authors’ IP rights. frontierda.xyz/faqs-projects

Funds raised from GR15 were used to partially underwrite a 12-week Fusion Energy As A Climate Solution weekly workshop series that ran from November to mid-January. Interviews can be found on Youtube.com/@frontierdao.                           

SCINET, INC @scinet_inc. At SCINET, we are increasing the speed, efficiency, and effectiveness of life sciences research from “lab to life” by developing a suite of software applications in a decentralized (""DeSci"") life sciences ecosystem that addresses the complex set of root causes for why it takes 17 years for life sciences research, including climate solutions, to get into real life (see here for socials, media mentions, website, etc.).

We help scientists conduct and translate research faster, more accurately, and more efficiently by offering them a unique confluence of decentralized funding, blockchain-protected IP, unique trust mechanisms, and commercialization strategies that reduce investor risk, increase scientific innovation, protect intellectual property, and positively impact the world and its inhabitants.

Option, @option_hq: Option is a prediction market for governance that incentivizes companies to align with community values, including those related to climate change, by making it profitable for them to do so. An example of climate governance using Option could be creating a market where players can make predictions about a company's carbon emissions reduction targets. If the company meets its targets, those who predicted accurately would be rewarded. This would incentivize the company to align with community values and reduce its carbon emissions in order to profit from the market. Furthermore, the funding provided by the market could be used to support research and journalism focused on climate change and carbon emissions reduction.

Science Fund, @sciencefund_io: Fund basic science with donations recorded for posterity on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Science Fund is empowering scientists to freely, openly, and rapidly pursue their best scientific ideas. To achieve this, we are reimagining how discovery is funded. No grant applications. Transparent, traceable funding records. Rapid funding cycles that support more ideas early and continue funding what’s working. In this Gitcoin Round, we plan to test some of the mechanisms we thought out. At least 80% of the funds collected in this round will go towards our first Climate Action funding pool, the “Urban Climate Impact Mitigation Pool”. 

Specifically we will support “UPP” - the “Urban Planting Project” incubated at the AKASHA Hub in Barcelona. UPPs mission is to turn every available city space into green islands of chill. By easing heat stress, UPP is helping to mitigate the effects of climate change and promote new sources for local food production in cities. UPP has already formed partnerships with local universities and communities to deploy its “UPP toolbox” and will apply S.M.A.R.T. principles to quantify the project's impact both through technology including real-time tracking, and satellite imagery as well as by documenting the social impact of their project.

Donors to our Gitcoin grant will be recorded in the funding pool through their Ethereum addresses and will receive certificates of the impact that allows them to unlock information and data about the project’s success at regular intervals in the future. 

Internet of Animals, @WildlifeMovemnt: Our mission is to create a community of scientists that promotes the design, development, implementation, and improvement of accessibility to software, hardware, and knowledge resources related to wildlife movement ecology. To realize that vision, we formed The Wildlife Movement Institute, a nonprofit organization to be a hub for this community for local, regional, and international collaborations – whether you are an expert or someone passionate about wildlife and technology. Since the end of GR15 we have established a bank account, set up a business account on CoinBase and are now preparing to invest in web development and getting 501(c)(3) tax status. 

Defi Biolabs, @Defibiolabs: Bioengineering algae to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
GR15 Grant: https://gitcoin.co/grants/7497/defi-biolabs-is-engineering-cyanobacteria-to-prod

Circonomy, @CirconomyDAO: Recycle & Reuse 2 Earn 2 put the “eco” in “economy” (https://www.circon.me). 

We aspire to become a DAO platform to proliferate circular economic projects all over the world. We'll accomplish this by building a dapp which will have a combination of on-chain registration of hardware-based circular economic projects such as Precious Plastic. This will be crowdfunded to ensure common ownership and stakeholdership. This will be supported by on-chain tracking of all recycling activity which will have a recycle-2-eajjrn cryptoeconomics model underpinning it.

We are currently creating a crypto-back solution for the world of recycling & reusing. We’ll accomplish this by tokenizing existing points-based recycling/reuse-2-earn programs administered by not-for-profit organizations such as Circulr.ca and RedeemClothingRecycling.com. This allows us to better empower end users with an interoperable incentive that would have a unified reward pool amongst all of our partners as well as grant more autonomy to our partners to scale their operations.

The high-level summary of our tokenomics is as follows - there will be a dual-token system whereby:
The token users will earn will be created by coalitions between brands and nonprofits so what we mean by this is - depending on the material in question and/or other factors, we’ll have coalitions of for-profit and nonprofit organizations that will mint a utility token together for earning. As an example - ideally, all clothing-recycling will have one utility token governed by all nonprofits that handle clothing recycling whilst the for-profits will be sustainable fashion brands. Likewise, all plastic-recycling will have one utility token governed by all nonprofits that deal with plastic recycling whilst the for-profits will be sustainable toy/merch companies. In that latter example, there may be multiple coalitions given that the toy industry is a specific/niche market. But regardless, we’re starting with the fashion industry as our MVP.

This utility token will not be tradable in the exchanges because Circonomy itself will have a token that will be liquid in the exchanges out there. This token will be token-bonded to the utility tokens within Circonomy’s ecosystem and thus in order for users to either obtain other utility tokens or liquidate them, they’ll have to exchange their utility token for the Circonomy token. Each utility token will be exchangeable for rewards such as discounts or exclusive access to brand events that are token-gated or NFT phygital goods. But if they don’t care about those things, they may simply liquidate by way of exchanging for the Circonomy token and then selling their Circonomy token, or they may stake the Circonomy token for gains of course and helping to drive value.

Grow Your Own Cloud, @_GYOC: develops regenerative data technology, storing digital data in the DNA of plants and trees, to create carbon absorbing data storage. 

It works! We’ve just been awarded the science breakthrough of the year from Falling Walls for our functional prototype 'Data Garden'. We’ve also just finished an EU-funded research project that demonstrates how urban scale implementations of GYOC could absorb megatonnes of carbon and store terabytes of data.

Now we’re developing a unique Web3 offering we call ""Non-Fungible Plants"" (NFPs). NFPs are physical plants with data encoded within their DNA. Data like JPEGs and MP3s. They’re the first truly plant-based NFTs ever created. They’re the first step to build data systems that work in harmony with living systems for maximum positive impact.

To enable our vision, within Web3 we are forming GYOC DAO: an internet-native organization dedicated to accelerating the transition to truly green data storage. Funds raised through this bundle will help the continued growth of an organization which more closely resembles a public good than a traditional tech company. Together we can create a future where server farms could be replaced by data forests.

We work closely with the local communities to create viable economic models as an alternative to deforestation.

🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳


Why Focus on Small Scale Forests? 🌳

Rural communities and small land owners have neither the resources nor sufficient amounts of land to receive compensation from forest preservation efforts through carbon offsets. This makes deforestation the most economically compelling option for them.

Fortunately, blockchains allow us to demonstrate the proof of impact of small scale conservation projects in a transparent and trustless way.  This makes it possible for us to design new ways to compensate rural communities for preserving their land.

Why Colombia? 🇨🇴 

Colombia is the second most biodiverse country in the world, the first in varieties of birds, orchids and butterflies.
This biodiversity depends largely on the survival of ecosystems like forests. 

50% of Colombia’s territory is covered by forests, however, we are losing 500 hectares of forests every single day.

What is causing deforestation in Colombia? 🪓🔥

- Lack of opportunities and education in rural communities. 
- Solutions to forest preservation like carbon credits are not a sustainable economic model for small-scale forests.
- Increasing deforestation in protected areas like national parks.
- Cattle farming and extensive agriculture
- Ilegal drugs production 
- Lack of infrastructure 

How do we avoid deforestation? 🐒


Our model aims to create avoided deforestation credits for small scale forests and collectives. Supporting local communities to actively create and manage their own projects. 
More info and model in our website www.kokodao.xyz 


Where is the money going? 💵

- Onboarding non web3.0 impact projects to crypto
- Recruiting team for social media and product development
- Support local school in the creation of an endemic tree nursery
- dMRV technology implementation in our pilot project: 15 hectares of native forest in Huila, Colombia.
- Legal expenses.

Shamba is building a decentralized monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) network to power regenerative finance - ReFi. Shamba also runs an ecological data oracle powering several web3 applications.

What we have achieved since GR15:

Since GR15 we have completed the development of our web app solution to support farmers getting into regenerative finance. We are now deploying this solution with farmers who want to start regenerative projects. (https://refi.shamba.app)

Building off of our success deploying the first web3 ecological data oracle last year (learn more at https://docs.shamba.app), we are now aiming to roll out a full digital MRV solution to support the ReFi projects.

Last year also saw us roll out tools for analyzing satellite imagery from various space agencies (https://insights.shamba.app) as well as tools for generating smart contract code that uses satellite data (https://contracts.shamba.app). These tools were developed to support the developer community to easily utilize ecological data in their web3 applications.

Why MRV: 


Carbon projects MRV has traditionally been expensive and oriented toward large-scale projects.

Our goal is to make MRV affordable by leveraging satellite data, machine learning, geospatial modeling and ground sampling. We aim to combine this with a network of skilled people to provide the data needed to characterize natural landscapes and quantify the impact of regenerative actions.

We aim to provide a cost-effective alternative to traditional MRV which is unaffordable to the typical smallholder. Once deployed, our solution will enable smallholders to access MRV services at an affordable cost.

Alpha Round Goal:

In this round, we aim to fund the collection of scientific data to establish carbon stock baselines. As we support farmers kicking off carbon project pilots in Kenya, we need to create datasets that reflect the above-ground and below-ground carbon stocks on these farmlands to act as baselines. This will allow farmers to quantify in the future the impact of their regenerative activities on carbon stocks by having a point of reference at the start of the activities.

Baseline data:

The data we collect will be synthesized into carbon maps that will be available to anyone who needs such data. Open data is one of the most important classes of public goods and we believe the datasets we produce will impact multiple projects and serve multiple beneficiaries.

The data will benefit not only small farmers launching carbon projects but also researchers and policymakers who need to make data-driven decisions around the climate and agriculture.

Pilot sites:

We will begin by mapping out carbon stocks in several sites in Kenya where pilot projects are starting, then expand to cover other bioregions as we refine our techniques. The funds we receive on this Alpha round will inform the geographical extent we can map under this initiative.

Target datasets:

We aim to create soil maps and land use land cover maps to quantify below and above-ground carbon stocks. 

We will use a combination of ground sampling, remote sensing, secondary data and geospatial modeling in creating these datasets.

This WaterDAO grant is a continuation of the ReFi DAO Water Circle grant made in GR15. Since GR15 the WaterDAO has grown quickly. The WaterDAO has already begun multiple research projects such as credit class development, solvent extraction desalination testing, and Solar energy desalination analysis tool feasibility. The WaterDAO also has two pilot projects planned to begin in 2023 to treat water. The goal of this grant is to help to bring the first RH2O credits on chain earlier than expected by focusing on developing automated monitoring systems and broadening our verification efforts. 

The purpose of the WaterDAO is to create transparency around sources of water, how they are generated, and establish a water credit classification system. We believe this can be done by creating a trustworthy and verifiable water credit that can be easily purchased and used to offset water usage. This would allow companies to continue to focus on their operational efficiencies while supporting the replacement of their water usage with equally efficient water producers.

The purpose of the WaterDAO can be summed up through four main goals:

1. Create a universally accepted water credit that is first supported by the Regenerative Finance (ReFi) community and eventually, by larger outside organizations. This credit class can serve as a building block for many types of water credits to be created.

2. The WaterDAO will act as a support mechanism to verify credit quality. The DAO will oversee specific verification standards to provide a certain level of quality, standard for the credits issued through the DAO.  

3. Incentivize companies to be ""Water Positive"" or at lease Water Neutral. This will come as the DAO expands and gains more influence. The DAO will make the process of becoming ""Water Positive"" a significantly easier process than it was previously, leaving companies fewer excuses to maintain their indifference. 

4. Incentivize more environmentally friendly forms of desalination and other water treatments. This is done through a tiered credit system. For example, a water producer using desalination methods that require energy intensive methods and that has a potentially damaging runoff, would only qualify for second tier credits. To receive top tier credits, water producers must power their operations with cleaner and less energy intensive methods while mitigating harmful runoff. 

RH2O water credits will be validated through the Regen Network. 

If you are interested in joining our mission, please visit our website and join the Discord channel to get involved, we look forward to seeing you!

A little bit more information if you have read this far:

The WaterDAO will not only be validating water credits, but also actively working towards increasing the development of water treatment and credits by funding targeted areas that the DAO deems to be impactful. These areas will likely include:

-Funding of specific tier 1 water treatment projects

-Water technology development

-Pilot projects leading to IP development

-Sponsor water research and development

-Acquisition of a specific water asset that can be licensed to water projects

By funding water treatment projects, the WaterDAO is able to further develop the water credit space. The WaterDAO treasury will hold assets that are created or purchased by that DAO. These assets can be licensed out to water producers to help them provide higher tiered credits. The DAO will get to vote on the licensing agreements for specific projects as well as which ventures will receive funding. 

Validating water credits:

Each credit validated by the WaterDAO represents one cubic meter of additional treated water that is added back into the water system that is represented by the credit. Water generators who participate in the WaterDAO can mine water credits using Proof of Water (PoW). Once a water generating facility is certified to produce regenerative water (e.g. solar desalination), it will receive a blockchain-enabled IoT smart meter that communicates directly with the network through Proof of Water. PoW is a way to secure water by ensuring that every regenerative water credit (RH2O) is backed by a physical unit of water mined on the RH2O network. Water miners are rewarded with water credits by using Proof of Water to validate the generation of a unit of water and communicate the data associated with that unit of water through the IoT smart meter. In the future RH2O tokens will serve as water contracts where physical water can be collected. In addition, the physical mining of water ensures that the creation (supply) of water credits is limited by the capacity to generate physical water and the value of each RH2O token is a function of the balance between supply (miners) and demand (users).

The WaterDAO will have specific credit classes based on the Regen Network that water producers must fall under in order to produce a specific credit. The first water credit will be for desalination projects and will generate RH2O (Regenerative Water Credit) tokens. Each Regenerative Water Credit measures one cubic meter of treated water that is added back to a specific water system. In other words, these credits are localized and set to the specific water system in which the water has been added. RH2O credits are only produced when water is verifiably added back into a water system.

We will create three tiers of water credits based on the applications suitable for the quality of treated water. The credit tiers are based on a 100-point scale designed to promote the activities we deem to be the most advantageous for the health of the environment and to stimulate technological innovation.

Those wishing to be funded through the DAO will be required to fill out an application form. Once completed, the DAO review committee will evaluate the results and assign values based on eight parameters.

The results of the application will designate the project as one of the three water credit tiers based off of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) in the treated water.

Potable Water Class: TDS less than 400 ppm and sterilized

Agriculture Class: TDS less than 700 ppm and healthy for the environment.

Industrial Class: Water of any TDS with a pre-approved buyer or application.

The WaterDAO could really use your support both through GR16 as well as participation in the DAO. We hope to see you around. Thank you for your contribution 🙏.

What?

In many fields, industry bends the arm of science and casts a veil of validity via “peer reviewed studies” to influence the public’s perception of a product. 
Here on the emerging frontier of ecocredits, we have the opportunity to shift the paradigm of industry science away from centralized + corrupt to one that is decentralized + credible. ReSci posits that an entity benefiting financially from the creation and/or sale of a given ecocredit should not be involved in the process of reviewing a methodology for approval and adoption as an ecocredit. 
Thus, ReSci Network aims to provide independent review in order to best prevent potential conflicts of interest. 

**Our essential responsibility is to assure that ethical science is at the core of ecocredit methodology development and peer review. To this end, we act as a community leader catalyzing the formation and flourishing of distributed communities of regenerative practice** 

How? 

We hold a 3-pronged approach for achieving our mission

1. Scientist and Methodology Project Databases

Human capital and expertise are crucial to achieving a project’s mission. We’ve created a two-part database in a public-facing Notion so that projects developing methodologies can find scientists with appropriate expertise (and vice versa) to consult while they are in the early stages of developing their methodology concept. 

Scientists: Please visit https://notionforms.io/forms/resci-network-scientist-directory-intake-form to complete database intake 

Methodology Projects: Please visit https://notionforms.io/forms/methodology-project-directory-intake-form to complete database intake. 

We appreciate your participation!

2. Communications Hub
Hosted in console.xyz, our communications hub is designed to natively host curated conversation as well as relevant resources such as Notion. Scientists and Methodology Projects alike can request access after completing intake to our database. The goal of the comms hub is to spark connection for collaboration and to support the methodology development and peer review sprints that we hold space for. 

3. Methodology Development and Peer Review Sprints 
Methodology Development sprints are intended for projects who have received approval of a concept note (from Regen Network or similar) and have not yet begun the process of methodology definition beyond a general outline. 
Peer review sprints are reserved for groups that have dedicated a significant amount of resources to the development of a methodology (specifically, collaboration with credentialed scientists). These projects are at the stage of a first draft whitepaper. 

We at ReSci Network are passionate about the role of ethical science in ecosystem regeneration. We believe that holistic ecocredits, if implemented via methodologies developed by ethical science, can act as a crucial component in a flywheel mechanism for long term funding in environmental stewardship.

How You Can Help
Please help us reach our goal of raising a total of $25k in Gitcoin’s Climate Alpha round by making any donation that is accessible to you and by sharing our project link to others who are passionate about science’s role in ecosystem regeneration. 

With $25k, we will be able to perform a full scale alpha methodology development and peer review sprint.  Funds will be allocated to sprint stewards,  a communications steward, and scientists who contribute to the sprint. Within the container of an 8 week sprint, we aim to compensate scientists at a competitive rate of $50/hr for their expertise. Beyond the cost of the sprint, funds will be allocated to cover a. further research of appropriate legal entities that can meet the needs of a truly decentralized scientific community and b. basic legal costs of organization upkeep. 

We were selected as a runner-up project in the December 2022 Future Quest Climate Pool and need funding to be able to sustain our momentum in building and weaving. Thank you for supporting our sustenance and nourishment through the winter. 🐻 💚

Sincerely, 
Sage and Ned

I'm Wasabi, the founder of Kokonut Network. We are building a bridge to connect web3 and agriculture. We are creating a blockchain-based cooperative to develop and manage a network of coconut farms.

Our main goal is to address the worldwide lack of funding for agricultural projects. We help farmers get the funds they need while creating opportunities for web3 communities by giving them access to perpetual natural assets.

### TL;DR

Kokonut Network provides blockchain governance and open-source accounting to the agricultural industry. Our mission is to promote, organize, fund, and manage coconut farms. We collect funds from the community through the Kokonut DAO framework for decision-making and allocating treasury funds.

Kokonut Network can establish a lifetime partnership with its members through the Kokonut DAO by using a formula of Agriculture, Blockchain, Web3, Perfect Soil, and Weather. This opportunity does not have an expiration date, as coconut trees are replanted once they stop bearing fruits.

**One-time contribution equals a lifetime of rewards and benefits.**

## Why coconuts? Zero Waste Circular By Default Crop.

Coconut is the most cultivated and vital palm tree in the world, as it is the main source of vegetable fat. It is one of the plants that provide a wide variety of products and by-products, serving as a primary source of food, drinks, and shelter for animals.

Kokonut V1 is a real-world eco-friendly agriculture project in its plantation phase. We have obtained planting permits and 620 acres of soil-tested land in optimal conditions, with access to water and the best weather in the region.

**Coconut products market outlook**

The coconut products market size was valued at $11.5 billion in 2018 and is estimated to reach $31.1 billion by 2026, registering a CAGR of 13.6% from 2019 to 2026. In 2018, the coconut oil segment accounted for more than half of the total coconut products market share.

Coconut is a versatile fruit with many health benefits. Its derivatives, such as coconut oil, water, milk, desiccated coconut, coir, and copra, are used in the food, beverage, cosmetic, and personal care industries.

### Kokonut V1

Our first plantation will yield 18 million coconuts annually, enabling us to generate multiple revenue streams in the food, health, and automotive industries.

This project will benefit the entire society of the Municipality of Las Salinas, Barahona Province, Dominican Republic. The coconut plants will be planted 7.5 x 7.5 meters apart, equating to ninety-six (96) plants per acre of land, or 60,000 plants across the six hundred and twenty (620) Acres of land. This variety of coconut yields approximately three hundred (300) fruits per plant, resulting in an annual yield of 18,000,000 units. The Kokonut DAO treasury will receive 100% of the profits.

The organization seeks to create 10,663 direct and indirect jobs through investments in this project. These jobs will focus on essential agricultural tasks such as weeding, applying pesticides and fertilizers, irrigation, and harvesting.

### **Kokonut DAO**

*The DAO is the core vehicle for all fundraising, rewards distributions, and governance decisions.*

Kokonut Network is a platform built by and for people. At its core, Kokonut DAO seeks to empower anyone who adds value to the Kokonut Network ecosystem, regardless of their social status or prior accomplishments.

Learn more: https://kokonut.network/dao

### **Our Vision**

Kokonut Network was created with the aim of reducing the obstacles to agricultural development, and rural project funding, and democratizing investment in real-world projects. We will use blockchain technology to establish multiple plantations across the country, providing advantages to the global crypto communities and everyone in the network.

### **What makes us different?**

Many DAOs have great ideas, copywriting, and marketing, but without a solid business model. Unfortunately, many of these projects are rug-pulled or abandoned by users due to a lack of quality products.

Kokonut Network has a distinct approach. Rather than establishing our proposal or business plan by taking advantage of our users, and attempting to get them to purchase some non-backed token, we have created a resilient system over time. It is backed by coconut plants on our land and has a DAO for governance, funds allocation, and rewards sharing.

🌿 About 🌿

The Impact App (TIA) is a mobile dApp for on-boarding + paying Regenerators & verifying practice-based climate solutions.

TIA is a project developed by Eco Labs, in coordination with key partners & collaborators: dMeter, Silvi, Digital Gaia, Regen Network open source methods registry, ReFi DAO, KokoDAO, Coffee & Carbon Collective, AgroforestDAO, ReFi Zone, Regen League, and Common Action / Myseelia. TIA will be complementary to other ReFi and dMRV projects and benefit the entire ecosystem by reducing on-boarding friction, and helping increase the supply of new ecological assets.

TLDR: Eco Labs is a collaborative on-boarding ecosystem for regenerative action. TIA is a mobile dApp that does three things:

1) Reduce friction by guiding people into ReFi projects that value impactful action
2) Collect on-the-ground data used to issue ecological assets such as Eco Credits on Regen Network
3) Pay Regenerators anywhere in the world by integrating with Celo



🪴 UPDATES: Thank you to all the regens who supported us in GR15 💚

this is what we've been up to the last few months:

1) Methodology Development - we worked with Djimo from Silvi Protocol & Diogo from AgroforestDAO to submit a concept note to Regen Network for our “Adaptive Agroforestry and Smallholder Stewardship'' methodology we’ve been developing while in Colombia. We also launched a 9 week collaborative sprint where we brought together folks like Ana Maria from KokoDAO, Darina from Coffee Carbon Collective, and Charlie from ReCommon to support each other in writing and editing methodologies.

2) Grants & Accelerators - we participated in batch 6 of Celo Camp, received an additional NSF grant to do 100 stakeholder interviews (starting February), and were honored to be one of the first 17 winners of the Future Quest grants! 

3) Pilot Projects - our team spent 3 months in Barichara, Colombia where we developed relationships with a network of regenerative projects, syntropic agroforestry food forests, and community farms. We learned a ton about regenerative practices and were able to begin development on the methodology mentioned above. The next step will be to return to Colombia this Spring and start implementing and testing the methodology & technology stack for dMRV with at least 3 specific pilot projects around Barichara.

4) Technical Lead for Eco Labs - during our time in Colombia, we had the pleasure of getting to meet & befriend Jillian Burrows, an extremely talented & experienced programmer with a diverse & esoteric range of interests & knowledge. We’re so excited to bring her on to Eco Labs as our technical lead, where she’ll be helping us weave together the many collaborative pieces that make up our ecosystem & products. 

🎯 Q1 goals: 🎯

1) additional fundraising - as we continue development of our tech stack, it’s clear we’ll need a lot more resources to successfully weave together an effective tool & platform. 

2) stakeholder research - we’ll be conducting extensive research & interviews on the market potential for Eco Credits

3) testing on-boarding & dMRV solutions on-the-ground in Barichara & other pilot locations around the world 


📜 Full Description: 📜

There is a growing number of people who want to take action to help regenerate our planet. This includes both existing land stewards who could benefit from more sustainable & resilient income, as well as communities who need to restore their local natural resources and build resiliency. One option for them to do so is to sell assets into the voluntary carbon or ecosystem services markets. However, the way that market is designed makes it difficult for would-be Regenerators to participate, as the costs for MRV (measuring, reporting, and verifying) their efforts are substantial, and therefore work only for large, professional projects.

There is simultaneously a growing amount of capital being raised to fund impactful activities, through for instance: NFT fundraising, individual donors, & companies who are committed to net-zero and other social good commitments. In expectation of increased demand, more and more markets for ecosystem services are being developed. As Nori founder Paul Gambil says ""demand (for high-quality carbon credits) is not the problem, supply is"".

One barrier for increasing supply is the lack of decentralized, low-cost MRV solutions. This remains a friction point for small-scale, community-initiated impact projects to start and scale quickly. Nonetheless, such projects represent the fastest and most robust path towards impact, as small communities form a ready-made, decentralized global community which has the capacity and incentives to develop a wide variety of local projects and maintain them over the long term.

Eco Labs aims to reduce the friction of these two forces connecting: Patrons (markets that support impactful activities), and Regenerators (people who want to get paid to take action). 

❇️ The Solution: ❇️

The Impact App is an app designed to on-board Regenerators into existing dMRV platforms and collect data in-app to provide additional basic dMRV solutions. It will include both a directory of user-friendly how-to guides for existing low-cost, transparent, and verifiable methods of impactful actions that anyone can get paid to do in their local environment, as well as versatile, adaptable, and modular solutions for innovative forms of smartphone based data collection. It will be built in collaboration with existing and newly forming communities & DAOs to seamlessly co-create custom methodologies that measure, verify, and compensate for regenerative actions of all types.

This mobile app & platform aims to help bridge the gap and reduce the friction between those who value impact (ReFi projects, carbon & eco credit registries & marketplaces, ImpactNFT collections, and Impact DAOs) and those who practice impactful & regenerative actions (Regenerators like farmers, land stewards, urban Regenerators, climate activists, etc.)

By aggregating, integrating, and partnering with existing dMRV platforms, TIA will be able to act as an index to guide Regenerators on exactly what options are available to them, how to start taking action & get educated on regenerative practices.TIA will build custom data collection tools built into the app to:

1) on-board new Regenerators into both established and developing ReFi & dMRV ecosystems

2) provide direct-to-impact financing for small-scale regenerative projects

3) increase the supply of new carbon & eco credits to carbon market platforms by improving accessibility, awareness, and education

4) facilitate knowledge exchange within communities by integrating with projects like Common Action

5) ultimately increase the volume of net carbon sequestration, watershed & soil health, habitat biodiversity, ecosystem restoration, and other regenerative practices

Why build an app?

An app makes accessing & recording information simple, which can:

1) Increase awareness of and make on-boarding easier for organizations that have ways of valuing impact, for example: Nori, Regen Network, Open Forest Protocol, EcoNavi, dClimate, Digital Gaia, Orgo, Pozzle Planet, Littercoin, TIST, and many more.

2) Provide those who value impact that aren’t currently implementing MRV solutions to create simple systems of data collection that verify impactful actions on-the-ground.

How will it work?

This Android and iOS mobile application will be built to serve multiple functions:

1) List an index/directory of all actions one can take which already have a funding counter-party and an existing MRV methodology.

2) Provide simple, user-friendly, step by step guides on how to utilize existing MVR methodologies & obtain a Bioregional Passport

3) Facilitate in-app payments to regenerative actors by integrating with Celo, a mobile compatible blockchain.

4) Register and verify information about its users using the Common Action ontology in order to filter what actions that individual can feasibly take part in (such as location, expertise, access to land + size and existing resources on that land, access to a vehicle, physical capabilities/disabilities, etc.) as well as link their profiles to Common Action to find experts, peers and resources that will help them on their regenerative journey

5) Collect data for custom methodologies using in-app tools such as images, video, location, audio, & temperature. Upload that data in public and transparent formats using IPFS / Filecoin such that anyone is able to verify and cross reference.

6) Provide resources & clear pathways for regenerative actors to obtain additional equipment or expertise which can increase the quality of data collected / increase pay. This could take the form of classes, obtaining certifications, purchasing IoT sensors or specialized measurement equipment needed to unlock higher paying methodologies.

7) Optionally redirect funds paid for regenerative actions to purchase products in-app, such as dynamic NFTs which can showcase & illustrate ones impact over time, and merchandise / accessories / tools which aid the regenerative actions (UV-protective clothing, knee-pads, gloves, tools tailored to specific methodologies)

🤝 Collaborations: 💖

Regen Network Methodologies
With their many decentralized methodologies being developed, Regen Network will enable Project Developers to issue EcoCredits of all types. Eco Labs is working directly with the Regen Registries team to make the process of learning how to start taking part in that process simple & clear within the Regen specific actions listed in The Impact App, as well as developing our own methodology, currently titled Adaptive Agroforestry & Smallholder Stewardship.

dMeter
Eco Labs is a founding organizational member of dMeter, where we are working to weave together dMRV techniques like human-sensing, sky-sensing, remote-sensing, and reputation-sensing as the low-cost, decentralized source of ground-truth used to issue and originate our Eco Credits. Leveraging the dMeter framework and ecosystem of partners will be key in our solutions.

Regen League
Jan from Regen League has been working on a simple version of an on-boarding app to start mapping out regenerative projects, hubs, individual regenerators, and infrastructure platforms. This open database will provide a foundation for us to start building Regenerator on-boarding systems & user profiles that will be utilized in The Impact App.

Common Action / Myseelia
Common Action is an innovation network focused on accelerating climate and sustainability action, by connecting individuals and organizations with each other and to actionable knowledge and opportunities. The Common Action Ontology - MRV module will be developed as part of this project, to organize information about geographically-based impact needs, regenerative projects, and resource requirements. 

Silvi Protocol
Silvi has been working on solving the human-sensing & tracking of tree planting using a mobile app. With the clear overlap in needs for human-sensing dMRV, Eco Labs & Silvi have partnered to build on top of the foundation of technology already developed, and use the Silvi app to perform human-sensing as part of the dMRV stack used to verify & originate Eco Credits. 

Digital Gaia,
We’re working closely with Digital Gaia to apply our methodology within their active inference & digital twins system, so that our Eco Credits will have a Digital Gaia FERN score associated with them from the very beginning. This collaboration includes working on UI/UX tools for Regenerators, creating models for regenerative practices, and supporting each other as we try to solve the challenges of making regeneration an occupation. 

Eco Art & Impact NFTs:

Eco Labs originated as a hub for collaborative, carbon negative NFT collections and ecological creativity. We're actively supporting and working with artists & creatives to inspire climate action, shape the narrative around regeneration, and help fundraise to support TIA development and compensate for regenerative practices once the platform is live. Here are some of our teams' current initiatives:

1) The World After Us: Imaging techno-aesthetic futures is a traveling solo exhibition of sculptures, installations, prints, and photographs that combine plant life with electronic waste, and scientific experimentation with artistic exploration + Phoney Plants, an illustrated, cross-chain NFT collection based on this real world work

2) Concerned Plant Society: a pfp project that is part of the ReFi NFT Coalition, ReFi Zone (a collaboration with ReFi Punks & Solar Sasquatch Squad)

3) Dynamic NFT experiments - this year we hope to explore the ability to link an NFT directly to the regenerative projects it’s associated with. More to come as we experiment with what’s possible!

••• TLDR ••• 
 
New definition of value.
 
Beyond GDP.
 
GDP only  - fresh air has no value. Air pollution causes disease, people in hospitals, and medical bills - good for the economy.
 
Living elephants have no value. Dead elephants have more value 🤷‍♀️ that’s why they are poached for ivory.
 
(the list of examples can go on and on)

The key concept of “Triple bottom line”  (people, planet, prosperity) —  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_bottom_line  — has been around for a while but we have the capacity to address the problem.

The timing is perfect for this project to succeed:
- satellites
- drones
- IoT sensors
- big data
- blockchain (transparency, integrity, incentives)
- awareness of climate change

We believe the bulk of the solution is twofold:
 
💰⏳ Upfront project funding via Tree-Commitments (We’re calling it Tree Forwards) to incentivize and reward performance-based tree stewardship
📍🔭 Extreme traceability and attribution of new trees, not just for accountability and inventorying, but to unleash the community effects needed for tree-planting to become a thing!
 
Let's unpack that 👆
 
Tree Forwards:
Silvi is collateralizing the net present value of New Tree Forwards by locking commitment budgets into performance-based schedules that reward tree stewards as tree milestones are verifiably met. This is built at the unit-economic level but scales indefinitely. Because there are 50-60k tree species, Silvi is supporting a p2p library of species-specific methodologies. Think of it as DeSci tree wikis for tree science and intelligence and citizen science participatory model for the ground work/truth
 
Ground truth and MRV:
Our focus has been on building a stack to serve the human-centric stages of the tree lifecycle while setting a strong and reliable decentralized science and open data foundation from which other Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) can happen. We're collaborating with dMeter and Regen Network on a Filecoin grant delivering a Claim Resolution Framework. Further, we'd like to collaborate and interop with other projects and technologies on techniques for statistical sampling of ground truth as well as remote sensing inference. And ultimately, we'd like to vertically integrate with carbon-certifying projects. 
 
Interface:
Silvi is building an app where we're leveraging social media mechanics with citizen science frameworks to develop a Pokemon-Go-like experience for gamified tree planting and stewardship
 
Tokenomics:
Silvi has finally started bringing its data on-chain via NFTs, IPFS. After that our long term plans involve launching a native governance token issued through tree commitments. Governance tokens will spawn utility NFT pairs that contain all the data and contracts for each tree, as well as the instructions on unique release schedules and requirements for commitment budgets based on tree type, location, timeline, relationships and stakeholders.

Pilots:
To date, Silvi has already deployed several pilots in the United States, including planting of 5 hardwood species and pines in a retired golf course while partnering with a conscious festival called Fire Flies Forest and experimenting with sapling distribution to homes and neighborhoods in Florida. Additionally, Silvi is partnering with EcoLabs and AgroforestDAO on the development of an adaptive agroforest methodology leveraging Silvi's Tree Forwards.

Silvi's biggest focus is currently in Kenya, where it is connecting communities such as schools and small holder farmers to Kenya's last rainforest, Kakamega forest. The project aims to build a methodology to help establish small, distributed nursery beds around the forest with the goal of improving supply of saplings. With the help of Gitcoin funding, Silvi has established operations in a dozen schools and 8 small holder farmers and approaching 100k trees propagated from seed. The project is in close conversation with the Forestry services and the Forest-run nurseries, Silvi is helping expand capacity of reforestation via its theory of change that a greater number of independent nurseries run by community members via a participatory model will help increase capacity and coordination. Silvi is close to being assigned an exclusive area for planting and forest management where our MRV and methodology will be put to the test over the following years.

Partners:
We're so happy to be part of dMeter where other awesome dMRV projects like EcoLabs, Athena, Avano and Orgo are working together to solve planetary restoration and natural capital creation! We're partnering with Ecolabs and AgroForestDAO on the development of an agroforestry methodology and also a core member of dMRVNetwork, an MRV research group aimed at serving small holder farmers. We're also proud to be supported by Celo and the Climate Collective and incorporating Celo's stables for payouts in Kenya

Why: Verification as proof of impact

How: MRV, Oracles, Impact Certs, Active Inference, Digital Identity

What: An anti-greenwashing toolkit

Bundle Description

🌍💡 Introducing Bundle #3: Verification Infrastructure 🛡️- the ultimate toolkit for proving 💚impact and unlocking 💰funding in the sustainability and climate solutions space.

This bundle brings together 🔥 12 cutting-edge projects that are changing the game for measuring, reporting, and verifying (MRV) impact. With our bundle, you'll be able to confidently prove that your projects are delivering real, tangible results.

Let's be real, in order to fund the solutions we need to save the planet, we need to show that our projects are 💯 and that the impact is 💪. That's where MRV comes in - it's the bridge between 💰 and 💚impact. These projects included in the bundle offer MRV solutions through 🔮oracles, 💻impact certificates, and MRV protocols which are making it simpler and more transparent for projects to prove their impact and secure funding.

Think of this bundle as your one-stop-shop for proving your impact and unlocking funding 💰. Whether you're working on 🌳carbon removal, 🌱afforestation, regenerative agriculture or you've doing grassroots community building - with this bundle, you'll have everything you need to prove your impact, access funding and receive rewards.

With this grant, we're powering up these projects to take the MRV space to the next level🚀. Let's work together to make sure funding is going to the most impactful solutions, and let's make a real difference in the fight against 🔥climate change.

What

Behind every product lies a hidden infrastructure—a complex ecosystem of factories, ships, robots, processes, and people working in harmony to deliver value. The web3 climate economy likewise requires an infrastructure of technologies, people, and services. That's us.

The Verification Bundle comprises a range of approaches targeting different pieces of the verification value chain. This includes project evaluation networks, oracles, impact certificates, and MRV protocols. We are also building apps and interfaces enabling climate entrepreneurs to easily plug verification into their projects. We are for climate entrepreneurs like what AWS is for developers.

Why

Current verification methods are expensive, inaccurate, inaccessible, or untransparent. These shortcomings are a bottleneck for both funding and entrepreneurs. Funders, from small donors, to institutional and sovereign funds, will not fund climate initiatives en masse until they can verify climate impact. Meanwhile the legacy, off-chain verification organizations cannot scale to serve the fast-growing, dynamic, and global mix of climate entrepreneurs.

Web3 technologies, like blockchain, enable new verification solutions that decrease cost, democratize access, increase accuracy, and create transparency. However, these solutions are not automatic. There is tremendous work to be done designing user experiences, aligning incentives, and building applications. Furthermore, we need to tailor solutions for the wide range of climate and sustainability initiatives.

Beyond accountability, verification projects are the foundation for a more immersive, and rewarding impact sector. Impact certificates (NFTs linked to verifiable impact) enable projects to symbolically represent their work with creative smart contract structures. For example, a tree planter could sell tree NFTs that produce carbon tokens for holders. These carbon tokens could then grant holders exclusive rewards from video game skins, to store discounts, backstage concert access, or project voting rights.

If we are successful, donating to climate impact will soon be as good, if not better, than buying things for oneself.

⭐ Digital Gaia @_digitalgaia www.digitalgaia.earth
If you want to teach people a new way of thinking, don't bother trying to teach them. Instead, give them a tool, the use of which will lead to new ways of thinking. (Buckminster Fuller)

The funding from this grant will support the launch of Digital Gaia's first product, called Gaia. It is the culmination of Digital Gaia's MVP sprint in Q3 and Q4 of 2021, which was partially funded by Gitcoin GR 14 and 15. 

Background on the research and thought leadership that goes into Gaia can be found at: https://docsend.com/view/s/gexztbntbf5vxsn9

Gaia is an AI-augmented assistant that helps the global regenerative community achieve more impact faster and with greater confidence. It is built on a novel decentralized AI platform and backed by state-of-the-art science. Gaia provides context-specific information, knowledge, decision support, and Impact assessment for the first mile of Impact rooted in the collective intelligence of a global network of practitioners, experts, scientists, data providers, and indigenous communities.

Gaia is built on Digital Gaia's open technology platform and will enable multiple high-value services missing today that are essential to scaling regenerative agriculture and healthy bioregional economies, including:

1. Expert Assistance for the first mile of Impact: Each instance of Gaia is a standalone AI for a specific ecosystem and community context. It supports and gathers context from land stewards and experts through local inputs and the use of multi-tiered remote sensing and other forms of MRV.
2. Open Access to a global commons of data, information, and knowledge: Individual Gaias are interconnected in an AI-augmented global network. Digital Gaia's AI tools autonomously integrate all the local information and knowledge into continuously improving scientific models. These consensus-based models feed back into the network, enabling exponentially faster learning and continuously improving performance against targeted outcomes at the local level.
3. Transparent and Immutable Proof of Impact on Regenerative Outcomes: Gaia produces real-time project assessments from pre-feasibility stages to end-of-life. It serves as an Oracle for both future predicted performance and realized impact across the life of projects that can scale from project, to portfolio, to bioregion.

Objectives

Our objectives for the first six months of the Gaia launch are:

- 125 Project Onboarded with >10,000 Hectares impacted
- A pipeline of over 1250 Projects in the onboarding pipeline with >100,000 Hectares impacted
- 7+ project aggregators integrating Gaia into operating models
- 55+ SMEs, Experts and Data Providers engaged in our global community
- 7+ SME organization, academic institutions, data aggregators integrating internal resources with the Gaia Network and Gaia POI oracle services
- Integration of Gaia POI Oracle Services into 3 Marketplace channels

We are building $Earth - First digital currency to be backed purely by climate solutions. Our goal is to -

1. Mobilize over $ 5 Trillion/yr for the next 30 yrs to provide primary finance to projects in clean energy, regenerative agriculture, clean transport , ecosystem conservation and clean tech that will build the necessary infrastructure for a net zero world.
2. Appropriately value natural ecosystems and their services while creating a monetary system that is backed by climate/ecology positive projects.
3. Build the Solarpunk paradigm


$Earth has been designed to make this happen by - 

1. Incentivizing users to purge their petro $$$ to mint $Earth directly at the protocol and use those $$$ to fund projects in renewables, permaculture, Ev charging stations, electric buses/trains , ecosystem conservation/regeneration, agroforestry, energy storage, clean tech etc
2. Inherently ascribing value to ecosystem services created by the projects we fund, by selling $Earth at a premium to the $ value of projects in the neoliberal world. $Earth acts as a unit of account for the $ value of the projects in our treasury + potential yields these projects will generate and the positive externalities created by these projects ( healthy soil, carbon sequestration, clean air, biodiversity etc)
3. Creating utility for $Earth by creating a network of regenerative/solarpunk merchants who are willing to provide their goods and services in exchange of $Earth. 


Thanks to your love and support during GR 15 we have been able to -

1. Onboard developers and designers to help us build our website ( love to have some CRITICAL feedback) which is now live. 
2. Our tech team has also been successful in encoding $Earth tokenomics into smart contracts on which we have now conducted over 1750 test transactions. 
3. We have also onboarded 3 solar energy projects in India, Malawi and Nigeria that we are going to pilot with (details on website) and are in talks with 5 more projects in regenerative agriculture and EV space that we will onboard in the coming weeks. 
4. Take active part in hosting Refi India

Our vision is for to support peer-to-peer, user-controlled alternatives to common location-based apps we use every day. We want new category of dapps and protocols that use spatial data to be open, interoperable and composable.


The Astral Protocol has three components:

- Astral's verifiable spatial data registries - smart contract-based registries of spatial data objects like points, lines, polygons and raster images, 
- Verifiable location credentials, to serve as presence claims in the Astral ecosystem, and 
- Web3-native geospatial data storage technologies so the data backing these systems is user-controlled, cryptographically verifiable, uncensorable and permanent.


These are linked components that will enable the ecosystem to build a Web3 map of the world, and location-based dapps that use that map.

Astral tools and standards will be useful in a range of different use cases ranging: 
- Regenerative project development and dMRV
- DAOs / digital governance: geofenced local and regional DAOs, local currencies, spatial demurrage
- Mobility: defining policy areas like congestion zones, capturing the position of connected devices like IoT and smartphones
- Natural capital currencies: defining ecological zones, storing physical measurements of ecosystem conditions
- Metaverse / gaming: virtual land registries like Decentraland and Cryptovoxels, and AR games like Pokemon Go


Grant contributions will fund the development team building these public goods. Specifically, we are developing a Solidity library of topological and geometric functions, Web3 GIS tools and a mobile SDK to create verifiable location credentials.

-The Concept-


The CM Guild, or Community Managers Guild, was born out of the idea that community managers and the ReFi community could really benefit from having a similar experience to that of founders within the ReFi Dao Founders Circles. With this in mind we are building this hub within the ReFi Dao server alongside, and with the guidance of the ReFi Dao team. The intention is to be another service within ReFi Dao, with Community Managers and ReFi community building as the focal point.

The Community Managers Guild is focused on creating a central hub for Community Managers from ReFi specific projects, to come together. A place to learn, teach, collaborate, and grow together. It is designed to be a safe place to enhance, learn new skills, and make connections in the space. The idea is for those who take part in the guild will become better at growing the ReFi community at large. With new skills and tools to build and attract more individuals to the ReFi space, and thus grow the overall impact being made.

-The Initial Structure-

The CM Guild will hold weekly workshops hosted by professionals in the space with an expertise in a variety of fields that are directly related with growing and engaging communities. There will also be product showcases where tools for community managing are shared. Representatives from those tool protocols will provide walk through training, demonstrations, and answer questions from Community Managers. All of these workshops will be recorded to create a library of educational content for future members to engage with.

-The Near Future-

Like the Founders Circles, the CM Guild will establish a cohort where circles are formed based on community type, location, phase of community development, and other factors. This will help ensure the greatest possible outcomes for the participating members. Each cohort will last between 6 to 8 weeks initially.

With the Community Managers Circles, fellow CMs will become more connected, and strengthen the overall ReFi community. The bonds created between fellow CMs during this time will carry beyond the cohort to further foster collaboration and community growth within the space. Cross pollinating and establishing a more connected tightly knit ReFi community overall.

We are also looking to create training courses utilizing a learn 2 earn platform, as well as providing access or memberships to paid for services which are beneficial to a Community Manager.

The training courses would offer a verifiable way for a community manager to prove they have completed a specific course and possess certain knowledge. This could be beneficial to future job prospects, or even current jobs.

These L2E courses will expose CMs to the experience of educational content on a platform that benefits the user. Together within the guild, members will have the opportunity to begin creating ReFi specific educational courses to be shared with fellow ReFi communities.


-The Immediate Impact-

One of the initial public goods the CM Guild will make available immediately, is the Gitcoin Grants Give-A-Thon. This is something one of our team members had started with another organization, and has decided to bring to the CM Guild believing it would be a better fit.


The Give-A-Thon is a marathon Twitter Spaces for ReFi grantees that takes place during the Gitcoin Grants Round. It plays host to a number of co-hosts from large organizations who are looking to support grantees in the round. Projects are invited to sign up for 10 minute slots and present their work and how the grant will help them achieve their goals. The intention is to give these amazing projects the extra exposure to potential donors, and grow the community.

-The Goal-

One thing that is certain, is that climate change is a global problem. The more people we can on-board to the ReFi space the greater the impact we can achieve. Community Managers play an integral role in growing, shaping, and engaging the very communities which will generate that impact.

By being a member of The CM Guild, Community Managers will have the opportunity to not only expand on their own knowledge and learn new skills, but help shape the entire ReFi community as a whole.

It makes sense that we invest in the people who are building these communities up.

-Use of Funds-

Funds from the grant will be directly deposited into a Multi-Sig for the following uses.

1️⃣Operational costs, e.g. funding the Gitcoin Grants ReFi Give-A-Thon 
2️⃣Creation of Learn 2 Earn courses designed for CMs as well as ReFi specific courses for the ReFi community
3️⃣Access to tools and materials for CMs
4️⃣A drip of funds to the communities that members represent, to be used specifically for community building events and campaigns to attract more individuals to the ReFi space

Future voting by well established members to determine best use of funds to help support and upskill Community Managers in the ReFi Space.",https://www.notion.so/refi-dao/Community-Manager-Guild-643e545b6f5d4417b9352bc170fc5491,,,Grants only,3,

The project leverages cutting-edge concepts such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and smart contracts to unlock new opportunities in financing forest conservation and rural development.

Treejer acts as a seamless, transparent bridge empowering local communities through crypto donations even in unbanked and remote areas. Treejer's approach incentivizes not only forest plantation but also conservation by locking up the funds in a smart contract and releasing it over time as planters and other data providers continue providing updates from forest status.

The protocol also provides proof-of-impact to donors in the form of dynamic tree NFTs that have real-world attributes. These NFTs are linked to each tree and are minted on Polygon network.

Treejer protocol has several smart contracts and two main interfaces: a payment and forest tracking interface offered to donors on ""https://treejer.com"" and a dedicated mobile app for tree planters and rural ambassadors. They use it to submit new trees, provide updates and unlock conservation rewards.

Besides using official interfaces, builders can integrate the tree planting plugin with their existing products.

MRV Foundation is a project that spun out of a founder’s circle in the ReFi DAO. Effective measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of soil regeneration, crops’ health improvement and biodiversity enhancement is critical to help small scale farmers and growers navigate tough challenges of climate change.
 
 
 
THE PROBLEM
 
Traditional MRV approaches are prohibitively expensive, often constituting 30-40% of the costs of implementing regenerative practices for large projects over 1200 hectares. What’s worse, these expenses are always upfront but the project developers are not able to receive revenues until the credits are sold after 5 years or longer. Additionally, the current MRV methodologies are analog, difficult to understand, very lengthy processes and often do not include regenerative practices valued by the local communities. Data gathered during traditional MRV practices is usually kept in silos and has no useful application or benefits for smaller farmers.
 
Small farmers produce ~85% of the world's food supply and they don’t have any viable solutions and support to switch to regenerative practices. This scenario offers us a significant opportunity for regenerative impact. MRV is a key component of building a system that can drive financial means to small-scale projects. Not only in agriculture - forestry, ocean, city regeneration.



OUR SOLUTION
 
To help small scale projects get full benefits of carbon, ecocredits and other incentives for ecosystem services, MRV Foundation is working to publish MRV101, an open source software-based guide to help small projects to quickly understand and implement relevant MRV best practices and reap the rewards. In the guide’s first edition, we are starting with agriculture, agroforestry, and small-scale farming examples.
 
 
 
DELIVERABLES (Each Phase lasting ~ 9-12 months)
 
Phase 1: Understanding traditional MRV approaches (Completed with the help and support from Solid World Carbon Expert, Mr. Durga Prasad)
 
Phase 2: Learning relevant MRV practices for Small Scale Projects in the context of pilot projects based in India. 
 
Phase 3: Combining our learnings with on-ground best practices and publishing the guide.
 
 
 
GR15 UPDATE 

We raised ~$45,000 in Gitcoin GR15. We are grateful for the Gitcoin Platform, the whole Gitcoin team and everyone who believed and supported us during GR15. Over the last three months, we have worked on the following:

- We did meetings with the ReFi leaders to learn how to best utilize the funds for MRV research.
- We welcomed a few open contributors to the core team for the agenda of research. 
- We organised deep-dive sessions with experts in the field of IOT, ReFi and Carbon Space to provide us with guidance during our weekly meetings.
- We invited pilot projects to submit project proposals as per the guidelines set by Bati.
- We received 5 pilot project pitches during the submission phase.
- The leaders of these pilot projects were also acting as open contributors for our MRV research. Hence, unfortunately, the question of conflict of interest started to arise. These leaders were also busy leading their own individual projects and were not able to contribute fully as per the needs of the MRV Foundation. These factors slowed down our research efforts and therefore, we unfortunately had to fully restructure our research team in December.
- For research, instead of relying on project leaders to act as open contributors, we have decided to partner with the agriculture scientists who are already doing research in the field of MRV. As the first step, we are partnering with Junagadh Agricultural University to engage with the academic researchers.
- We are also in discussions with a few farmer collectives to get access to their farmlands for implementing pilot projects.



USAGE OF FUNDS FROM THIS ALPHA ROUND

- Providing stipend to academic researchers and core contributors - 50%
- Documentation of research - 20%
- Providing for operational expenses of the foundation - 20%
- Providing for legal and compliance expenses of the foundation - 5%
- Towards strengthening ReFi Space in India to ReFiIndia - 5%


 
 
IMPACT AREAS
 
- Incentivise smallholder farmers for doing regenerative practices and MRV documentation.
- Improve the scope of VCM to include Biodiversity and other forms of credits.
- Increase citizen participatory methods in VCM, ReFi and climate action.
- Build collaboration with the DeSci community.
- Bring existing MRV tools for the application in small scale projects.
- Develop new tools where gaps are identified.

Hibiscus DAO is building the first transparent, open-source, community-owned toolkit for the fashion creator economy.

We want to return power + ownership to creators and producers - and eliminate negative human rights and environmental externalities from the fashion supply chain.

WHY?

Current Landscape of Apparel = Exploitation

The apparel and luxury market is growing exponentially: reaching $1.9 trillion globally in 2019 - and expected to surpass $3 trillion in the next decade.

But the industry's success is rooted in exploitation. Its business model is based around maximizing profit - by minimizing value returned to stakeholders.

Traditional Fashion = Humanitarian Exploitation

Slave, child, and sweatshop labor are all common in the supply chain of traditional brands.

These human rights violations are well-documented but suppressed via marketing and PR. 

Traditional Fashion = Creative Exploitation

Talented young designers generate massive value for brands - often with little to no compensation.

A successful, popular design will earn a brand millions, yet the designer behind it will see none of these earnings. Instead, their designs become the IP of the brand.

Traditional Fashion = Environmental Exploitation

Fashion brands intentionally leverage planned obsolescence and instill an increasingly consumerist mindset based on overconsumption to feed their continued need for profit. 

When overconsumption is encouraged, true sustainability is impossible to achieve.

We’re a **black-led** team and here’s what we’re working on:

Enabling Profit Redistribution + Transparent Supply Chain + Community Ownership = Human Rights Impact

Hibiscus recently created the first ever on-chain profit redistribution contract for garment production - redistributing profits from FWB merch sales to supply chain participants.

Hibiscus is looking to build on this by onboarding sewers, pattern makers, printers & other workers from the garment industry who are ""stuck"" working for a factory with no access to profit redistribution - giving them ownership over the value they create.

Building cryptographic profit sharing into our tooling enables the creator economy for apparel production by retaining and redistributing the value created in making and wearing apparel. 

Crypto technologies help share ownership with stakeholders:

- Community owned ateliers vs. factories and manufacturers.
- Fork-able concepts and tools can be validated and iterated on by community creators.
- Designs registered as on-chain vectors - enabling proper credit and compensation.
- Future royalties of products can be distributed back to creators and the community.
- Locally accessible physical design and fashion resources.

Building a Transparent Supply Chain

Creating open source, end-to-end apparel production supply chain + tech infrastructure that allows creators to easily create new garments on existing bases - via on chain portfolios that can forked, remixed, and recombined.

Creating “Proof of Ethical Production” + Oracles

Eventually, we want to create a system of producing clothes that uses consensus-driven blockchain technology to verify products are being made ethically.

Fighting Fast Fashion = Environmental Impact

As a part of our stack - we are working on the first solution for holding fast-fashion polluters accountable.

Since the last Gitcoin grants round, we’ve created the first model for on-chain profit redistribution in fashion - successfully experimented with the on-chain profit redistribution to stakeholders who previously had no access to upside from their IP. We’re almost ready to drop a case study - open-sourcing the process behind this historic collection.

Now we want to enable supply chain provenance and environmental transparency in the garment production process: create and test the first functional model for an open-source apparel supply chain to show how the garments were produced and the corresponding environmental impacts. 

Supply Chain Accountability

What does this look like in practice? 

Now that we’ve experimented with profit redistribution - we want to run experiments to figure out how to capture garment production metadata on chain.

And after that - putting these new data capture + manufacturing processes into practice by experimenting with a garment collection that incorporates provenance and accountability around environmental impacts of the collection.

We hope that our efforts will set precedent and can serve as a model for future apparel projects. The current landscape of crypto fashion is “merch” that encourages wasteful consumption, enablement of existing exploitative power structures, and no regard for the environmental impacts.

Hibiscus seeks to change that by providing an alternative approach that enables sustainability which already reduces waste or gives accountability around environmental impacts of garment production.

Open-Sourcing a Model for Ethical Clothing Production

This experiment will inform the development of environmental oracles that will allow any apparel project to open-source their environmental impact and adopt new environmental standards - all done via leveraging supply chain metadata arising through the garment production process. 

This supply chain experiment will be done with local supply chain participants in Toronto, Canada - with the hope of subsequently expanding out into other countries. 

Hibiscus is creating and open sourcing the first model for a decentralized, transparent supply chain in fashion. 

How = Utilizing L2s for Real-World Crypto Use Cases

Blockchain technology is often criticized by naysayers as not having real-world uses. 

Hibiscus’ goal of creating an open-source, community-owned supply chain is one of the strongest examples of an IRL use case for crypto. 

In order to create a truly sustainable, community-owned supply chain for clothing, Hibiscus needs to focus heavily on grassroots community work - onboarding sewers, pattern makers, textile producers, and other supply chain participants.

In many cases - these supply chain participants are members of underrepresented groups: people of color without much exposure to technology - who would be vulnerable to exploitation by traditional fashion industry structures and institutions.

These participants in the garment supply chain have never heard of blockchain before.  

Onboarding them onto Ethereum mainnet -  and having them pay anywhere from a few dollars  to a few hundred dollars in gas fees - is simply not feasible for this demographic.

Instead we will work directly with these local supply chain participants to onboard them into crypto via L2s - which can provide an accessible, feasible entry point to these new ecosystem participants. 

We hope to use L2 infrastructure as foundational substrates to build real world utility and onboard new non-crypto native users.

We will open-source this process to create onboarding resources and serve as a model to other projects who are building real world use cases on L2s - to help accelerate driving real-world adoption.

What’s next on the roadmap?

We’ve hit our short term goal to use liquid 0xSplits to experiment with redistribution contracts for primary sales for garment workers since the last Gitcoin grants round.

We seek to build on this success by creating garments made using a transparent supply chain by open sourcing garment production metadata - proving out our model for supply chain accountability.

Through this process - we will onboard underrepresented communities onto Ethereum L2.

As mentioned above - we’re working towards a system of producing clothes that uses consensus-driven blockchain technology to verify products are being made ethically, without negative human rights and environmental externalities. 

With an improved model we can build better to do more, produce less, and return value to creators and users.

What can each of us do to help regrow the world's forests?

So far, the answer has been a very frustrating, ""not much"". 😡

Unless you have a few million dollars to invest, until now you simply haven't been able to directly help plant forests in the places that most need them. So we've been forced to rely on governments and big companies. 

👨‍🎤👹  THE ANGRY TEENAGERS ARE ANGRY ABOUT THIS  👹👨‍🎤

Now we've channeled that anger and used to blockchain to build a solution. 

We've created Angry Teenager tokens that each hold a vote in a DAO. The funds raised from selling tokens goes into the DAO wallet, and then they vote to release funds to plant trees in the real world. 

This has involved innovation not only in the smart contracts that manage the DAO (check our white paper for more details on ""opt-out voting etc), but also in real world legal contracts 👳‍♂️. All of that work is open sourced, of course. 

Each token is geo-located to a specific square within the project 🧩. So buyers can see exactly where their money is going, and the piece of land that they have reforested. They can also watch 🔭 the trees grow over time because the tokens regularly and dynamically update with photos and other data. 

👣EARNING CARBON CREDITS👣
As the trees grow, token holders earn carbon offsets which they can use to offset their carbon footprint. You can have 100% transparency and so 100% confidence in the work that is creating your carbon offsets. 

💰THE VALUE PROPOSITION💰
=> Individuals and small companies can now fund the creation of a forest on a specific square of land in Africa, starting with investments as low as $150. 

=> They can watch that forest grow, and share photos and other media about the project with their customers and friends. 

=> They earn super high quality carbon credits that they can use to offset their carbon footprint. 

=> If Ever they want to stop earning carbon credits, they can sell their token on the open market - if the price of carbon credits has risen, this might even make them a profit :)

********************UPDATES SINCE GR-15******************

=> Smart Contracts fully audited
=> Artwork. Beautiful artwork is complete. 
=> $10k Pre-Sale tokens sold to raise funding for the first test planting on 2 hectares. 
=> Verra Project Design Document 90% done. This allows us to generate Verra-authenticated carbon credits which have the highest value.

We are weaving information into a shared knowledge network, a coherent systems map for cultivating collective inteligence.  

🔥
Humanity faces a converging cascade of interconnected crises: ecological, economic, geopolitical, educational, psychological..  without a shared map for collectively navigating away from collapse and towards a flourishing future for all.

🗺️
Myseelia means to map the pathways towards planetary regeneration by cultivating a federated knowledge graph, integrating individual perspectives and data silos into shared knowledge and wisdom.

🌱
We are starting with people and projects already in the web3 impact space. By giving them tools to grow their own profiles with their wants, needs, ideas, values, claims etc, we can connect these subjective perspectives together into a coherent systems map via Myseelia.

🙋
Our proposed solution, a searchable knowledge base, can address key questions:
- How can I generate wealth aligned with what I love and what the world needs?
- Who is already creating impact?  How?
- Where are there regenerative investment opportunities?

💻
With funds from this grant we will build out the first stage of Myseelia, including
- A backend graph database
- Semantic search
- Personalized recommendations
- Graph visualization

Our soils are dirt. Soil is the most valuable and least valued resource. There is drought, flooding and leaching of our soils. People are diseased. Our food is deplete of nutrition (even organic) and we face a growing public health crisis triggered by the decline of beneficial microbes and the rise of pathogens. Mother Nature does not need us...but we need her healthy and strong.

Land degradation is a collective threat for everyone. We have a plan and creative vision that can reverse this damage and make farmers, gardens and plants both abundant and sustainable. It is vitally important we make this transition. This is our mission.

Problem #1
SOILS all over the world are currently DIRT. They are losing microbe life and the foods we eat have little to no nutrition as a result.  Without ""good guy"" microbes, soil, plants, and humans are unhealthy. 

IT IS TIME TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF OUR SOILS which is intricately entwined with HUMAN HEALTH

Problem #2
Our envisioned Project Site is currently being prospected by a gasoline corporation. This is a classic story of: Little Microbe vs Big Chemical Corp.  The time to act is NOW!

This project site would become the center of operations for Living Ground and we intend to become the Microbe Education Center for South America.    

Now for the good news. Living Ground a project in Ecuador, South American. We are creating a project that mimicks Nature.   We are farmers of beneficial microbes. We have created a change the world project that addresses and initiates solutions for many problems including climate change.

Our primary intention is to heal the soil by farming and spreading the beneficial microbes but Living Ground is so much more. We've created a whole system project where microbes, people and plants can enjoy success and health! Microbe tourism, education center, gardens, restaurant, cooperative, gourmet store, essential oils, apprenticeships, health clinic, regenerating land, office to preserve land and water......and more!!!!! We've created a whole system where microbes, people and plants can enjoy meaningful employment, success and health.

The Soil Squad Ecuador found the perfect site for our microbe mission to house the Microbe Education Center.    BUT, we discovered a gas station was interested in this same property. So, we made a deal to purchase without the funds needed.

Imagine a project that circulates around the beneficial microbes to ensure success, health, healing and touches life with hope!  When the beneficial microbes are healthy, the earth's soil sponge is health.  The soil sponge is responsible for healthy climates and ecosystems.

It is important everyone understands that soils (sand, silt and clay) hold massive amounts of nutrients and carbon in soil everywhere.....but these nutrients are not in available form for the plants without the beneficial microbes.

A collective of 13 cutting edge projects working at the forefront of the digital carbon revolutions.

------------------------------------------
About the Carbon Markets Bundle
------------------------------------------

Carbon markets are an important way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow down climate change. These markets work by allowing people and companies to buy and sell emissions reductions. This GR16 bundle is a collection of projects that help people understand and reduce their own emissions, and make it easier for them to buy carbon credits to offset the emissions they can't reduce. This bundle includes projects innovating to raise awareness, create demand, and facilitate the supply of carbon credits, all of which are necessary for a functioning carbon market.

------------------------------------------
How the grants funds will be used
------------------------------------------
The funds raised will be divided equally between all bundle projects. Funds will be invested into increasing demand through improved scoring, increasing supply and improving guaranteed quality of supply, promoting the marketplace to ensure demand can meet supply. Ultimately, the consumer is best served through a strong marketplace when there’s competition and choice. The grants funding will contribute towards that.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The funds raised in this bundle will be shared equally amongst the following 15 projects:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dottyland Impact Self 🌳 @dottyland_xyz : On-chain Impact Self. Turning climate-positive actions into functional and serviceable identities across web3 applications, starting with on-chain carbon token retirement.

Carbon Flow 🌳 @CarbonAntiTheft : An anti-theft solution for global carbon markets, a multitoken system restricting the amount of carbon tokens converted. Multi-trillion carbon market just makes no sense without anti-theft. It is a smart contract that limits the amount of theft in carbon markets. Everybody can create a carbon token. The owner of a carbon token can allow conversion into it from other carbon tokens, and set limits (absolute or per a period of time) of conversion from that other tokens. So, for example France’s DAO sets the amount of Paris’s carbon tokens that can be exchanged for France's token. So if Paris is found guilty, France can pause exchanges from Paris tokens and devalue their token. If Paris during some error produces a septillion of carbon tokens, they can’t be exchanged for an upper level, because of the anti-theft limits. Tokens can be retired (voluntary denial of carbon production) and retired tokens are meant to be used as a means of payment. Every carbon token owner (such as a notary) can set his “tax” on the retirement of tokens, so notaries and DAOs compete on the free market. DAOs can also mint retired tokens to reward somebody, e.g. for climate science progress. The smart smart (not a typo) contract is developed, it remains to create a DAO around it.

Coorest 🌳 @CoorestOfficial : A decentralised application for carbon offsets utilising a 100% on-chain CO2 sequestration via satellite validated NFTrees, CO2 tokens and Proof of Carbon Compensation (PoCC) certificates. 

KlimaDAO Name Service 🌳 @knsdomains_ : A domain name NFT that permanently locks up carbon credits, continuously offsets carbon credits and can be used as a social representation of climate impact. Currently integrated into KlimaDAO pledge dashboard, making it easy to access climate commitments using .klima domain names. 

Clime Tech (Formerly Clime DAO) 🌳 @ClimeTechInc : Climate action and resiliency tool used by cities and business for adaptation and mitigation. Carbon reduction verified, stored on chain and issued tech based carbon credits. 

Mangrove 🌳 @mangrovecarbon : Mangrove is building the operating system for carbon removal companies to eliminate the risk of double selling supply, improve sales processes, easily bring inventory into the refi ecosystem and ensure compliance with government and registries. 

ERC-Cool™ 🌳 @TresCoolLabs : The ERC-Cool™ is an improved implementation of the ERC721 smart contract standard that weaves real world, perpetual, carbon removal into any NFT use case that adopts it. An open source - planet cooling - super sustainable - delight. Designed to spark a removal revolution, enabling action to become the fabric of web3 and sprinkled to every corner of the internet.

KUMO 🌳 @kumo_dao : KUMO unlocks the value of natural assets by providing interest-free loans against their market value. Loans are issued in our native stablecoin, which literally locks carbon into money. KUMO turns the act of owning a dollar into a climate action.

ECORISE DAO 🌳 @ECORISEDAO :  ECORISE brings liquidity to the real estate and natural capital asset market and unlocks stored value through tokenization of these assets and bringing them on-chain.  Landowners are incentivized and rewarded for regenerative and restorative actions that increase their natural capital asset value and provides new sources of revenue from ecological economics.  

Carbonland:
Carbonland Trust 🌳 @CarbonLandTrust : a carbon credits registry offering natured based carbon removal credits from biodiverse forest land that is being enrolled into perpetual conservation. 
Carbonland DAO 🌳 @CarbonlandDAO : a Nature Preserve Timeshare that leverages the Carbonland Trust protocol to issue and sell carbon credits from its own forestland. Carbonland DAO acquires property by selling CDAO tokens, the governance token of Carbonland DAO. Token holders can use CDAO to vote where Carbonland DAO buys property, and can spend CDAO to make reservations to visit and stay at Carbonland DAO’s nature preserves.

disCarbon 🌳 @discarbon_earth : creates transparent and verifiable emission estimation and carbon retirement and tools available as public goods within the Ethereum ecosystem. disCarbon’s aims are to raise awareness about the impact our actions have on our planet and accelerate the adoption of on-chain carbon credits.

Changeblock 🌳 : investors can gain access to groundbreaking green credits that are streamlined and independently verified, allowing for the creation and listing of unique instruments on our platform. As the first to offer an end of life plastic credit in collaboration with Fusion One, we have demonstrated the ability to develop credits for any green initiative, providing investors with a unique opportunity to support and benefit from innovative sustainability efforts.
ChangeblockNFT: ChangeblockNFT helps demonstrate commitment to sustainability and social responsibility. We enable NFT companies to improve their reputation, reduce risk and attract top talent whilst making a positive impact on the environment. ChangeblockNFT has the following 3 key features: 
NFT Asset Wrapping: Enhance the value and marketability of your NFTs while supporting UN SDGs with our asset wrapping service;

Born from Carbon DAO, The Aetlas Protocol is a ReFi protocol that is designed to connect the ReFi ecosystem and unlock new inflows of green capital. We designed a liquidity and retirement mechanism that offer the best of both a liquidity pool and an NFT marketplace. This offers the ReFi ecosystem a liquid marketplace that retains the unique values offered by each individual carbon project.


Who’s this for and what are their problems?


There are five types of users in the Aetlas Protocol:

🌱 Project Developers: 
A user who manages a carbon sequestration or emission reduction project issuing carbon credits on a supported on-chain carbon offset registry. Their main objective is to sell the carbon assets they created. Their considerations are a balance between time to sell and price per carbon metric tonne. With greater liquidity in a carbon market, comes a significant reduction in time to market. However, liquidity focused markets often mean the project developer sacrifices any additional value of their individual project.


🤝🏽 Carbon Traders: 
A users that buy and sell carbon assets for profit. They often look for opportune assets to buy and supply willing buyers who don’t have the time to search themselves. The problem they face with existing pools is the additional fee they incur (up to 10%) for withdrawing carbon assets from liquidity pools. This reduces the number viability arbitrage trades which creates a less efficient market and creates barriers for new inflows of green capital.


❇️ Liquidity Providers: 
A user looking to capitalise on 15x expected increase in demand for carbon in the next 7 years. They are users who hold carbon assets and who provides liquidity to the ReFi ecosystem. The problem they face is that carbon is a depreciating asset. An 2005 carbon credit is worth less than an identical 2020 carbon credit.


🧺 Offset Funders: 
This is a protocol or community who funds offsetting of the carbon emissions their users generate. The barrier for funders is the technical requirements, sustainability expertise and co-ordination to design an effective on-chain carbon portfolio.


🧍Offset Curators: 
This can be an individual user or a sustainability focused DAO. They often have the time and sustainability expertise but lack the funds to execute their vision for a greener tomorrow.

Aetlas Protocol solves these dilemma by separating the retirement and carbon portfolio curation process from the transaction of funds. We have designed a series of deployable autonomous liquidity pools interconnected with a carbon NFT marketplace and powered by a carbon offset funding mechanism.


🌱 Project Developers will have access to instant liquidity for their carbon assets but will be able to monetise their additional value post-sale. This is achieved by a Dutch auction held by the liquidity pool for all newly deposited carbon assets.


🤝🏽 Carbon Traders benefit from zero % fees for withdrawing carbon from liquidity pools.


❇️ Liquidity Providers have minimised exposure to the depreciation of individual carbon assets with a liquidity pool acting as a carbon index that actually generates a yield from the retirement of sold assets. The healthy connection between the NFT marketplace and liquidity pools also helps prevent stagnation older assets.


🧺 Offset Funders are unlocked with an incredibly simple funding mechanism. It can be deployed as simply as “Send X USDC to this address + a list of wallets who will curate your portfolio” or the funding process can be integrated at a transactional level within the smart contracts.


🧍 Offset Curators are empowered by the funding mechanism to design and implement any variety of impact investment strategy.



The Technicals:


Functions - Instance of the Tokenized Vault Contract


Deposit Function: This function allows traders to deposit TCO2e tokens into the tokenized vault contract. The function first checks that the receiver's token is held by the smart contract, and that the sender has approved the contract to transfer their tokens. It then checks that the sender's tokens meets the pre-determined selection criteria using a function called isValidTCO2e. Upon depositing a TCO2e tokens, the function then calculates, mints and transfers the appropriate amount of xCLP to the sender using a function called calculateXCLP and the mintXCLP function. xCLP represents a percentage ownership of the underlying assets held in the smart contract. If the TCO2e token does not meet the criteria, the function will reject the tokens and return it to the user.


Withdraw Function: This function allows users to withdraw TCO2e tokens from the contract by burning a corresponding amount of xCLP in the users wallet. The function should check that the user has sufficient xCLP and that the requested token is held by the contract. If these conditions are met, the function should burn the xCLP and transfer the requested TCO2e tokens to the user.
RetrieveTCO2e Function: This function allows a user to retrieve an array of all the TCO2e tokens held by the tokenized vault contract.


Swap Function: This function allows a user to swap a TCO2e tokens that is not held by the tokenized vault contract but meets the tokenized vault's pre-determined selection criteria with a TCO2e tokens that is already deposited and held by the tokenized vault contract. The function takes three arguments: the address of the sender (the trader who is sending their TCO2e tokens), the ID of the sender's TCO2e tokens, and the ID of the receiver's TCO2e tokens (the TCO2e tokens already deposited in the tokenized vault contract). The function first checks that the receiver's token is held by the smart contract, and that the sender has approved the contract to transfer their tokens. It then checks that the sender's tokens meets the pre-determined selection criteria using a function called isValidTCO2e. If these checks pass, the sender's TCO2e token is transferred to the smart contract, and the receiver's token is transferred to the sender.


isValidTCO2e Function: This function checks that a TCO2e token meets the pre-determined selection criteria for the tokenized vault. It takes a single argument: the ID of the TCO2e tokens. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the token meets the criteria or not.
calculateXCLP Function: This function calculates the appropriate amount of xCLP to be minted or burnt when a TCO2e token is deposited or exchanged in the tokenized vault. It takes a two argument: the ID’s of the TCO2e tokens and the quantity of each. The function returns a uint256 value representing the amount of xCLP to be minted or burnt.


mintXCLP Function: This an internal function mints xCLP for a given wallet address. It takes two arguments: the address of the wallet and the amount of xCLP to be minted. The function updates the total supply of xCLP and the balance for the specified wallet address. The amount of xCLP minted is must be restricted to a 1:1 ratio with the deposited number of TCO2e tokens.


Functions - Instance of the Treasury Pool Contracts:
FundOffsetUSDC Function: This function allows users to deposit USDC into the contract. Upon deposit, the function mints the ERC20 token OFT (Offset Funding Token) with a 1:1 ratio to USDC deposited and proportionally distributes it to a list of wallet addresses provided by the user. The USDC is then added to the contract's funds, dedicated to purchasing TCO2e tokens from any instance of the Tokenised Vault Contract.


FundOffsetERC20 Function: This function allows users to deposit any ERC20 with a corresponding Uniswap USDC pair ****into the contract. Upon deposit, the function swaps the ERC20 token for USDC using the correct Uniswap pair. After USDC is depoisted into the function mints the ERC20 token OFT (Offset Funding Token) with a 1:1 ratio to USDC deposited and proportionally distributes it to a list of wallet addresses provided by the user. The USDC is then added to the contract's funds, dedicated to purchasing TCO2e tokens from any instance of the Tokenised Vault Contract.
Retire Function: This function allows users who received OFT to retire specific TCO2e tokens held by any instance of the Tokenised Vault Contract. The calculateXCLP function in the relevant instances of the Tokenised Vault contract holding the specified TCO2e tokens is called to retrieve an array including each xCLP and the corresponding amount required for the transaction.The calculateUSDC function is called for the array of xCLP required returning value for the requiredUSDC. The OFT equal to requiredUSDC is transferred from the user to the Treasury Pool Contract. The swap function on the UniSwap USDC/xCLP pool contract is called to exchange the USDC for a corresponding amounts of each xCLP. The function should then call the **Withdraw** function of the relevant instances of the Tokenized Vault Contract to exchange the xCLP for a specific TCO2e token held by the contract. After the exchange is complete, the function should burn the OFT and route the TCO2e tokens through the Retirement aggregator contract.


calculateUSDC Function: This function calculates the appropriate amount of USDC required to swap for a list of xCLP variants.It takes a two argument: the ID’s of the xCLP tokens and the quantity of each.The function calls the quoteExactOutputSingle function in the Uniswap USDC/xCLP pool returns a uint256 value representing the amount of USDC required for the swap.RetrieveTotalFunding Function: This function allows a user to retrieve a uint256 value for the total amount of USDC deposited.


Other functions:

RetrieveSourceOfFunding Function: This function allows a user to retrieve an array of all the total amount of USDC deposited by each corresponding address (AKA funder).


RetrieveFunderContribution Function: This function allows a user to retrieve a value for the total amount of USDC deposited by a specific address (AKA funder).


RetrieveTotalRetirement Function: This function allows a user to retrieve a uint256 value for the total amount of TCO2e tokens retired.


RetrieveCurators Function: This function allows a user to retrieve an array of all the total amount of TCO2e tokens retired by each corresponding address (AKA curators).


RetrieveFunderContribution Function: This function allows a user to retrieve a value for the total amount of TCO2e tokens retired by a specific address (AKA curators).

Africa and S. E. Asia,"The essential preliminary data required to formulate a hypothesis around decentralized technology, ecological data, and regenerative economics is not visible to us.


Measurement, results, and verification of ecological health, as well as transparent accounting are not recorded in a standardized and secure manner. 
This siloes grassroots savings cooperatives from the formal economy of climate financing.

🌱

Research Narrative
Chamas operate as commons of ecosystem regeneration and community finance. They are however excluded from the billions of dollars of Climate Financing due to a lack of proof of regeneration and inadequate KYC/AML.


Using existing open ledger technologies and participatory verification; our project will develop a framework to explore the integration of these economies into the global financial system in order to sustain viable livelihoods of land stewards. 

In so doing, we make their value legible to open up new pathways for funding and support, and to forward planetary regeneration.

🌱

Regen Foundation will steward a research study into the existing governance systems of regenerative savings groups called Chamas. 

This research is a pilot study to establish a baseline framework on how Chamas can integrate ecological monitoring technologies with ecosystem service markets for the development of viable local regenerative economies. 

🌱

With the amount raised in #GR15, we have worked on
1. Identifying Chamas in regeneration
2. Initial stakeholder meetings 
3. Advisor and expert search 
4. Feasibility studies
5. ReFi Literacy gap identification 

🌱

The proceeds from Alpha Round will be used for
1. ReFi bootcamp for land stewards 
2. Web3 Encyclopaedia development
3. Feasibility study into DAO tooling for Chamas 
4. Video content generation on the powerful work these groups are doing 

🌱

The financial and political incentives to fight climate change, soil degradation and systemic degeneration are insufficient to mitigate and reverse the risks we face as humanity.

📃Our Proposal

🟢Why?
Today, most commercial seeds available in the market are bound to intellectual property rights – the majority being owned by an oligopoly that is slowly becoming the owner of our food chain. 

🟢What?
Hemp is an ancient plant that has been used for around 10.000 years, and one of our most powerful instruments for producing positive socio-ecological impacts. It has an extensive application range in various industries such as food, textile, construction and many more.
Despite such functionality, the highly centralized ownership structure makes it harder to experiment with hemp and adopt sustainable & regenerative business practices with it.

🟢How?
🌱Earthist considers heirloom seeds as public goods. We aim to protect nature’s legacy and transfer it to future generations without degeneration. We work for sustainable land regeneration at scale through hemp farming and aim to incentivize small/family farmers to adopt decentralized MRV technologies for positive ecological impact while producing carbon-conscious raw materials.
 
🪄Since GR 13:
✅We have found and collected four different types of lost heirloom cannabis seeds from across the country and have safely stored them in our seed bank.
✅Over 6.250.000 seeds were successfully planted and harvested by farmers in five different regions through our network.
✅We have given away 70% of our hemp seed related products as a gift to the community in order to improve health and raise awareness about regenerative hemp farming and heirloom seeds.
✅Collaborating with amazing climate projects such as dMRV Network, Atlantis and Digital Gaia (Augmented collective intelligence to integrate real-world data with natural models to continuously evaluate real global impact, using seeds as an ancient tool for cybernetic communication)
🌱We’ve invested in mechanization and bought a hemp seed dehulling machine to make the first local hemp hearts from heirloom seeds. 
🌱 We have opened a Gitcoin community-supported ""Everything-Hemp-Store"" in Istanbul 💚 Thanks to this, we will also have a small space for 9-10 people to host hemp and regeneration-related workshops.

➡️Next
Gitcoin Alpha Round 💚

The number of local farmers in the country by the end of 2021 was 512.000 as opposed to 1.122.000 in 2011. Moreover, with inadequate political and economic decisions given by the government, inflation rates in the country have risen to 181%. 
There is a bottleneck between farmers and the market as a result of the lack of investment and equipment in our sector.
As Earthists: 
🟢We have to be the market makers, farmers, producers, subject experts and consciousness changers all at the same time. This is not an easy task though!
Now, 
🟢We need to improve our machinery to accelerate the production of hemp goods. In this way, we can show the proven value and amazing potential of the nonpsychoactive variety of the cannabis plant with more than 96 different hemp-based products. All made by Earthists for health, cosmetics, textile, paper, construction etc.
🟢This is an amazing opportunity to show people that they can eat it, drink it, read it, tie it, wear it and live in it all while rapidly generating the soil and protecting the climate with your support! 
💜Hemp is hope and a vital part of the solution to today’s problems!
Thank you for your support.

Support Climate Action in the global south by contributing to our project. 

Quadratic funding rewards your support with a higher matching contribution from the common pool.

🌲

Context
The climate crisis has an undeniably more destructive and noticeable effect on communities living in the Global South.

At the same time, Climate action in the Global South can be substantially more permanent, effective, and impactful especially considering the populations and the solution opportunities available there.

🌲

Opportunity
There is an urgent need to build Climate change mitigation, adaptation, and resilience solutions. 
This can be achieved faster and at scale by leveraging technology. The current systems of banking, finance, carbon markets, nature based solutions, and conservation are inadequate to serve planetary regeneration. 
Blockchain technology enables collaboration at scale, decentralized governance, and crowdsourced financial models to Climate Action. 

Most of this ReFi activity is concentrated in the global North.

Our aim is to accelerate
1. Education around Climate and Blockchain. 📖
2. Project discovery, Funding, and scaling. 📈
3.Supporting Proof of Concept's as well as
4. Enabling ""interoperability"" conversations around Language, code, tokens and regulation.🤝

🌲

Past work
Over last year; we have been actively surfacing the global south across ReFi conversations in the ecosystem - supporting projects, individuals, and initiatives.

September 2022
Supporting Founders in ReFi DAO with grant applications and a marketing guide in conjunction with ReFi DAO

October 2022 
LOA Labs organized the Greenhouse retreat under the BICOWG aegis with active participation from the global South

November 2022
India’s first ReFi summit with active participation of Climate changemakers, ReFi Projects, Founders, Investors and Developers.

December 2022
Grants Roundtable with Gitcoin, Polygon, Celo, Climate Collective, Solana Foundation, Regen Foundation and Hbar Foundation. 

ReFi Gratitude NFT collection

Twitter spaces in local languages across Nigeria, Singapore, and India

🌲

Over the course of the year; we have supported projects across Australia, Japan, Abu Dhabi, Africa, and South America.

In order to bring this global need to local action, we need to leapfrog communities onto Web3.

🌲

Going Forward.
The proceeds from this grant round would go towards

1. Educating Climate(mitigation, adaptation, and offset) projects around leveraging tech(Web3) to scale MRV, project funding, market access, and interoperability
2. ReFi Gokarna - India’s first ReFi Hackathon at a biodiversity hotspot.
3. ReFi Ambassadors across Singapore, India, Nigeria, Uganda and more
4. Roundtables with Regen Investors and around raising Grants
5. Documenting Climate(+  impact) blockchain projects as use cases for local Industry( and Regulatory ) engagement.
6. Innovation corridor ( Accelerator model )  enabling cross pollination of capital ( nature based or otherwise), technology transfer, assimilation of indigenous nature based practices and Harmonization of Standards and practices across Language, code, and tokens

This would be in conjunction with Web2 and Web3 industry.
    

🌲

Drip
For the Gitcoin Alpha round, we shall be sharing the grant - with 5 % of proceeds going towards the ReFi Gokarna Hackathon. 

🌲

We cannot address climate change without onboarding the global south to technology and governance models that scale impact. 

We invite you to contribute to this initiative to scale Climate Action through ReFi.

We develop fun to play casual games to educate as many people as humanly possible on the Climate emergency. The gameplay will be carbon negative leveraging Toucan protocol’s Nature Carbon Tonne pool. Players can actively reduce their carbon footprint by in-game offsetting! Our mission is to accelerate decarbonization with gamification and the blockchain technology.

Game basics: It’s time to win back the Rainforest! With the Amazon on the brink of collapse, rise up and become a Guardian. Players start their adventure by building their own eco-friendly village in the heart of the Amazon. They build, research, and unlock buildings to train troops and acquire resources. It’s a social game where players can team up and form their own tribe. Gamers are introduced to real world environmental projects and educated about the climate emergency in a fun way. In the second phase players engage their forest-friendly troops to launch attacks to take back the rainforest from evil and corruption.
 
Climate Impact: Climate Guardians gamifies carbon sequestration in forests. The forestry systems and their climate-related functions in biomass production, conservation of ecosystems, sequestration of carbon, are critical to prevent climate change. These functions need to be enhanced worldwide while their degradation needs to be stopped in tropical countries. Recent studies suggest that this contribution could be doubled if the right incentives would be provided to support afforestation and forest management. By gamification we want to make as many people aware of these pressing issues and enable them to take climate action in-game. 
 
What’s next: We continue to focus all efforts on developing great games with real world impact and gamified education. Together we’ll accelerate decarbonization and preserve the rainforest for generations to come!

Humanity must choose to either embrace economic transformation or continue down the path of destruction, desecration and resource theft via war, infringement and oppression. We see many people, worldwide, standing up to denounce the latter. The mission of these projects is to steward and lay the foundation for emerging economies and indigenous communities that are built on the principles of abundance, knowledge sharing, trust and an intimate connection to our fellow human beings, nature and ourselves.  
The initiatives represented by this bundle include work in First Nation and Native American Communities, LatinoAmerica, Uganda, Nigeria, Kenya, and India with disparate aims but a common mission to demonstrate and expand the role of Free Open Source Software in public goods funding. With your help we will be able to continue our work in climate action, clean energy sovereignty, indigenous justice, the global water crisis, postCapitalist education, regenerative agriculture, mangrove restoration, SolarPunk IoT, and advocacy of both people and Earth’s rights.
Gitcoin offers a means for each of us to reclaim agency over the economic system that we rely on. Let us be empowered and demonstrate the potential of quadratic funding to allocate, prioritize & support transformative change.
Together we can empower communities through sustainable, scalable agriculture, climate action, clean energy sovereignty, equitable access, resiliency, advocacy and local environmental achievements. 
If you would like to know more about the individual projects that have gathered in this bundle, check below!

🌞 KhalonBridge, @KhalonBridge: Nigeria is at the leading edge of the web3 ecosystem but suffers from a notoriously collapsing electrical grid that impedes developer talent from keeping up with the digital economy without having to buy pollutive generators. Khalon Bridge is a development studio collective of over 40+ web3 operators and continues to provide residential solar to emerging talent in the region to advance the digital economy in Africa.

📡 ReconTech, @emergir.co: Imagine a world in which our technological devices help us to interact more intimately with the more-than-human world, expanding our consciousness by cultivating new cognitive and sensory perceptions. ReConnection Tech (devices & experiences) seek to materialize this kind of world through experimentation with Music from Plants, Smart Forest Baths and more.

🌻 Urbánika, @0xUrbanika / @urbanika.lens: An immersive activism school that turns passive citizens into active city shapers capable of using web 3.0 tech, peer governance, and commoning to facilitate transitioning into regenerative ways of living.

🧑🏾‍🤝‍🧑🏻 Vlinder: ""Papariko"" - Restoration of degraded mangrove areas in Kenya, @vlinderclimate: Verra-certified mangrove restoration project to provide a variety of ecosystem services, climate change mitigation, economic considerations, and active participation of the local community in coastal areas of Kenya.

☕ Coffee Impact Collective, @Coffeeimpactco: The project supports coffee farmers in their transition to regenerative agriculture by providing agronomic guidance and rewarding them for implementation of new practices. Coffee Impact Collective creates an ecosystem that provides multiple services and opportunities for farmers, allowing them to become a part of a decentralized marketplace where “regenerated” coffee is traded along with eco credits (like carbon, biodiversity, water quality, social impact and eco tourism), not separately. First pilots are starting with farmers and cooperatives in Colombia.

🏵️ Kangra Gardens, @Kangra_Gardens: The Kangra Gardens are a place for people to express gratitude and give back to the earth by respecting and learning from it. The purpose of the Kangra Botanical Garden, which is a part of Kula, is to regenerate the local ecosystem, promote biodiversity conservation, support community health, build towards food sovereignty and nutrition, and engage people in connecting with the environment. The garden uses Ayurvedic medicine production and syntropic farming to achieve these goals facilitated through a Bioregional Learning Center. The grant for Kangra Gardens aims to fund new as well as current contributors and the development of the gardens themselves to share with the global community.

🐘 Elephant in the Room: @ClimateRace : Strategic Climate Solutions Campaigns. We work with Indigenous organizations, voting organizations, neighborhoods, cities and activists to promote climate action to communities around the world and to counter the vast array of fossil fuel advertising and disinformation. Over the past year Elephant Room has also been creating strategic communications that are focused on the web3 community.

🛢️ Beyond Fossil Fuels: @BFF_campaign : Indigenous Legal Fund for Climate Action. Presently supporting 2 major projects - 1) Tsleil-Waututh Nation Sacred Trust’s opposition to the TMX pipeline and 2) We Stand Together : a legal climate case that is aimed at ensuring systemic climate planning and remedies for legally binding, science-based climate recovery policies. First Nations have standing under the ratified UNDRIP (United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples) Act in Canada and can invoke their unceded rights in legal proceedings to effectively defend and protect the environment.

👨🏾‍🌾 Project regrò : @projectregro Under the increasing climate emergency pressure, the regrò project aims to connect land owners, farmers and growers, interested in sharing resources to build resilient agro-ecologic systems through Regenerative and Conservation Agriculture, Permaculture and non-invasive practices.

🌳 Ayowecca: Wetlands and peatland ecosystem restoration has been our focus. Together with the local community, we are restoring encroached wetlands and protecting those that already exist. Our strategy involves agroforestry and afforestation. We are promoting agroforestry, by giving farmers fruit trees. Climate change adaptation and mitigation are our primary goals in promoting agroforestry. The effects of climate change on agricultural communities can be lessened by planting trees in agricultural systems. Growing the amount of trees on agricultural land decreases tree cutting and boosts carbon sinks.

🦋 Cambiatus: @_cambiatus -  social currencies to foster planetary regeneration. Working with the Paiter Surui indigenous community to create the Paiter Coin and onboard their members into the web3 space.

🐬Project Toninas: @yaqupachauy Project Toninas is long term project focused on the research and conservation of the Lahille’s bottlenose dolphin T. truncatus gephyreus, a subspecies of bottlenose dolphin that only occurs in Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. They are only ~ 600 individuals left across the entire distribution (Uruguay population~ 70🐬). Project Toninas is carried out by Yaqu Pacha Uruguay, a civil non-profit organization dedicated to implementing and promoting projects for the conservation and study of aquatic mammals in Uruguay and the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean.
